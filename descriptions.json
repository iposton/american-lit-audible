      "description": "This book was recovered after it went missing around the time of the revolution it was found in England and finally published. It covers the era of **1608-1651**. Most of this book are letters written to British investors that expected the pilgrims to get settled and ship goods back to England. It describes relationships with Native Americans and the French settlers. There are descriptions of conflicts with how some of these early settlers behaved. Side notes such as sailors who wouldnâ€™t share their barrels of beer with the pilgrims. The difficulties of planting crops and staying alive the first year are inspiring to hear. He tells the story of why they left England and took on the challenge of braving the dangerous trip to America."
