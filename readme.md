# Pieces of American History through audible books

## This is a collection of audio books, majority are non-fiction

I wanted to take a look back on the beginning of what inspired the America I live in today. Instead of reading a text of American history written by somebody alive today I wanted to hear voices that wrote about the past while living in the past. It's like getting in a time machine and going as far back as 400 years ago when Pilgrims migrated to New England. Listening to dialog and conversations that happened over 100 years ago is fascinating. Each author often references their influences, their favorite books and favorite authors and it inspired me to do some more research to help me find more things to listen to.

1. (Published 1651) [* Of Plymouth Plantation](https://www.audible.com/pd/Of-Plymouth-Plantation-Audiobook/B07BYSWNBD) by [William Bradford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bradford_(governor)) – This book was recovered after it went missing around the time of the revolution it was found in England and finally published. It covers the era of **1608-1651**. Most of this book are letters written to British investors that expected the pilgrims to get settled and ship goods back to England. It describes relationships with Native Americans and the French settlers. There are descriptions of conflicts with how some of these early settlers behaved. Side notes such as sailors who wouldn’t share their barrels of beer with the pilgrims. The difficulties of planting crops and staying alive the first year are inspiring to hear. He tells the story of why they left England and took on the challenge of braving the dangerous trip to America.

2. (Published 1791) [* The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Autobiography-of-Benjamin-Franklin-Audiobook/B002V1OIOU?qid=1616368914&sr=1-2&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_2&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=VGZXNFZMWPR5RZZTZT59) by [Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin) – This book is surprisingly easy to follow and written in a modern tone for the time in which it was written. It covers the era of **1706-1789**. Ben writes about the origins of his parents and their background. He has stories about writing for his brothers printing press company under a fake name. He tells a story about how he threw his drunkard friend off of a boat for not helping them row the boat. He tells us about his travels from his home down to New York City looking for work. He goes into to many details of the characters that he meets along the way, particularly his first boss he worked for as a printer assistant in Philadelphia. He describes his involvement with the British in the French and Indian war. He talks about his time living over seas. The first half of this book takes a pause and then there is two letters from curious minds that urge ben to continue his life story. He has a chapter dedicated to the beginning of American currency. Great read.

3.	(Published 1992) [* Daniel Boone: The Life and Legend of an American Pioneer](https://www.audible.com/pd/Daniel-Boone-Audiobook/B002V0TINM?qid=1616435415&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=M37K31F4D9HABQRSS41X) by [John Mack Faragher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mack_Faragher) – I let this book slide because I ran out of credits and it was part of the free library and it covered the era of **1732-1820** which is what I was looking for. The author used some of Daniel Boone’s actual writings and stories from his close relatives. It's a slight parallel to Franklin’s life story he too was involved in the French and Indian war. This story digs deep into his relationships with Native Americans for whom he admired. Interesting tails of growing up in the 1740’s. This book describes a time of pioneers starting to go west and build out settlements in Kentucky, which was heavily maintained by the Indians, which kept most of the coastal settlers away. All the fighting over land ownership caused many battles with the Indians and trips to the court to have a judge hand out rights to the land. Boone is described as an introvert. This book includes adventurous stories about being kidnapped by Indians of the Kentucky territory.

4.	(Published 1821) [The Memoir of Thomas Jefferson](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Memoir-of-Thomas-Jefferson-AmazonClassics-Edition-Audiobook/1713543753?qid=1616435648&sr=1-5&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_5&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=5E3ZKW8FQWVWFK3P67E3) by [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_jefferson) – This was not as easy to follow as Ben Franklin’s autobiography. It covers the era **1743-1790**. Perhaps using Franklins autobiography as a template he too writes about his family's origin. He talked about his teachers who inspired him growing up. He reads the entire declaration of independence with the edits and revisions included. He had an interesting story about taking a note from Ben Franklin while Ben was on his deathbed and he gave it to Ben’s grandson. Jefferson expected to see it get printed for public but had yet to ever see it again. I tried to research what happened there but info was limited.

5. (Published 1853) [* 12 Years a Slave](https://www.audible.com/pd/Twelve-Years-a-Slave-Audiobook/B00EZSV37C?qid=1616453153&sr=1-4&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_4&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=HAY4G07RZ46NJM5BFMT0) by [Solomon Northup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Northup) – This book spans the era of **1841-1853**.  This is a powerful book. While reading it I thought this must have inspired the civil war because it was such an awful experience for someone to go through. This book is filled with so many details of the harsh life as a slave. It starts by Solomon describing his daily life and some details about where he's from and family background. He describes the ugly mean faces of the traffickers. He describes the brutal sadness of kids being taken away from their mothers. This book will put you right there in the experience that Solomon suffered through and it’s hard to read.

6.	(Published 1852) [Uncle Tom’s Cabin](https://www.audible.com/pd/Uncle-Toms-Cabin-Audiobook/B00C5OC5KM?qid=1616454443&sr=1-2&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_2&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=ZG7TR596GERW6EHERYDY) by [Harriet Beecher Stowe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Beecher_Stowe) – A great description of how people talked to eachother at that time. There is so much interesting dialog. This story was inspired by a former slave Josiah Henson’s memoirs. The references in Uncle Tom’s Cabin describe the era of **1830-1849**. Digs deep into the hypocrisies of white American culture. A great description of the kindness of children who don’t see things the way their parents do. She tells a story about how slaves that were able to invent and engineer machines would be moved to mindless labor out of spite. Stories of how slave children are often separated from their mothers. I was inspired to read this because it’s been said to have help start the war to end slavery. This book combined with 12 years a slave had to have ignited the move to abolish slavery for good.

7.	(Published 1914) [* Journal of A Trapper: 9 years in The Rocky Mountains, 1834-1843](https://www.audible.com/pd/Journal-of-a-Trapper-Audiobook/1094001171?qid=1616454645&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=DFKZWXA1F5FN2ZP573MS) by [Osborne Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Russell) – This book spans the era of **1834-1843**.  It’s a straightforward story of fur traders making their way west for work and interesting encounters with Indians. It has many descriptions of different types of pioneers and their conversations. Escapes near death experiences out in the wild. He provides descriptions of food, drink and clothing styles of this time. How people interacted with one another. This book is similar to Mark Twains book called Roughing It.

<a name="grant"></a>

8.	(Published 1885) [Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant](https://www.audible.com/pd/Personal-Memoirs-of-Ulysses-S-Grant-Audiobook/B004CM3W48?qid=1616454798&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=NVA3TJ1G8AJYW1AKKN0W) by [Ulysses S. Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant) – This book spans the era of **1822-1885**. The majority of the book is very detailed descriptions of each battle he was involved in during the civil war. He starts by telling a story about getting a raw deal by buying a wild horse and was embarrassed by it. He offers some insight about how and why the war started and the moments that led up to the conflict. Talked about getting hospitality from civilians in the south even though they were enemies. He made many points that if not for bad commands they could have ended the war sooner. He describes interesting thoughts about the press of the time and some of the issues he had with them. The final chapters of the book were very engaging up to the very end and of course he shares his memories of President Lincoln and some of their conversations.

9. (Published 1872) [* Roughing It](https://www.audible.com/pd/Roughing-It-Audiobook/B006OR7DOY?qid=1616455117&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=YTMZ8A7ZJVEX4C5RZGN5) by [Mark Twain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain) – This book spans the era of **1861-1867**. Mark twain heads west with his brother who gets a job in Nevada. Mark does a deep dive on the Mormons and their religion. And even heads to San Francisco and eventually he gets to Hawaii. He describes people and their language so very well in this book. If you want to go in a time machine to the old Wild West Mark Twain will take you there. Describes several types of people amazingly. Stories about friends playing pranks on him, fights, drunkards, explains why some people headed west with gold fever trying to get rich quick. He has a strange story at the very end about getting his ass kicked by I think his employer. Not sure if it was true I tried to research it but could not find more about it.

10.	(Published 1929) [Nine Years Among the Indians, 1870-1879](https://www.audible.com/pd/Nine-Years-Among-the-Indians-1870-1879-Audiobook/1541445090?qid=1616455213&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=DCZMSA1QZ1FR61F0EDKM) by [Herman Lehmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Lehmann) – This book spans the era of **1870-1879**. It’s a fascinating story of an 11-year-old boy and his younger brother kidnapped by Apache Indians in Texas. The narrator, the man who was kidnapped as a boy, tells in great detail of the many hardships and harsh treatment by the Indians. The Indians raised the boy as if he is from their family. He has many close calls with death and eventually identifies as a Native American and learns how to get along in their world. I like this story very much it is very entertaining and it is as close as you can get to see how a real Indian tribe lived in the nature and their customs and brutal punishments to those who dare not follow their rules. The Indians had particular eating habits that white people were not used to and the author has a lot of stories about the native cuisine. Many stories of the type of people they would run into in the wild and fights with other Indian tribes. This young man became quite skilled with the bow and amazingly he ended up living with both Indian tribes the Apache and the then eventually the Comanche.

11.	(Published 1901) [* Up From Slavery - The Autobiography of Booker T. Washington](https://www.audible.com/pd/Up-from-Slavery-Audiobook/B002VA8GBW?qid=1616455378&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=JF2JD8WN6QTH7N6W0TM2) by [Booker T. Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booker_T._Washington) – This autobiography spans the time of **1856-1900**. Booker T. Washington has a lot of wisdom in his story. He focuses on getting an education to raise himself up, but not just getting the education but the right kind of education and skills that would be desired. He starts his story born into slavery and worked his way up through education. He writes about if you can’t afford something making it with your hands will teach you a valuable lesson. He has stories about teaching Native Americans and then spent most of his life building schools in Tuskegee, Alabama. He has rich stories of his teachers and students. He talks about the people who helped him along the way. Towards the end of the book he talks about a big speech he made in Atlanta and the importance of bringing the north and south together. He had lots of generous support from the north and the south to help build his school. He and his students built the school with their own hands. They laid the brick before they opened their books. Plenty of great details such as becoming great and skilled at something. I was inspired by his clear basic descriptions of how to live life. A natural born leader. He goes into the detail of how nervous he would get before his big speeches. He had great stories of staying with families in the south when he first arrived.

12.	(Published 1903) [The Souls of Black Folk](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Souls-of-Black-Folk-Audiobook/B0047WU6B0?qid=1616455451&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=21X9SZPXNXF0Y8GBKTET) by [W. E. B. Du Bois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois) – This story spans the era of **1840-1903**. This book is a descriptive narrative of black history post slavery in the late 1800’s. This is a story about De Bois looking for work as a teacher in Tennessee and eventually finding a job as a teacher. He talks about the southern struggle and the difficulty in farm life and making enough money to move up in the world. He has poetic prose in his writing. His chapters are titled which makes the story easy to consume from chapter to chapter and he offers quotes from his inspirations to start each chapter. He talks about black leaders of the past such as Booker T. Washington. He has updates on some of his students and what became of them as they grew up.

13.	 (Published 1905) [The House of Mirth](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-House-of-Mirth-Audiobook/B002V59XB4?qid=1616474554&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=BMKPJN89F5A87PB7TBTG) by [Edith Wharton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Wharton) – This book describes an era of the end of the 19th century. This is a fictional story written by a woman author and the main character is a young 20 something woman. I wanted to get the perspective of a woman about how people behaved and what was important to the people of this era. After listening to the opinions and facts of black working class it was a contrast to shift into a story of white elite culture at the turn of the century and the difficulties fitting into high society and finding a husband or wife to marry. The problems in this culture were petty and not as serious as the struggles of the poor people of the south but still problems to find a way to be apart of something for survival is the struggle described in this story. There are good descriptions of how wealthy people spent their money and how they valued it at the turn of the century.

14.	(Published 1907) [The Education of Henry Adams](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Education-of-Henry-Adams-Audiobook/B0051VVB06?qid=1616474712&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=5HY9Z1YR5G7VNF8VD4SK) by [Henry Brooks Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Adams) – This story spans the era of **1838-1906**. The theme of this book is the author’s thoughts about the education he received and the education needed for the future to come.  The story digs deep into the education he received from people who taught him their outdated education because that’s what they were taught. He never seems satisfied with learning outdated education because it doesn’t serve him in a rapidly changing world. His prose is very elegant rather than specific and direct. Starting from his birth he breaks each chapter into chunks of years. He is the grandson and great grandson of former presidents of the United States. He did a lot of his education abroad. He pays attention to social behavior and has lots of opinions about differences between Americans and British and Europeans. He references the history of Rome and compares similarities to the happenings of his time in the 19th century. Henry Adams drops so many names in this book it will create a fun task to google all the people he talks about and send you into some lovely rabbit holes. He really gets to the core of how people lived in the 19th century and social games people played especially people involved in politics.

15.	 (Published 1919) [* My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla](https://www.audible.com/pd/My-Inventions-Audiobook/B077RHCZX1?qid=1616474760&sr=1-3&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_3&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=95V0BN242MXH19YGWW5X) by [Nikola Tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla) – This story spans the era of **1856-1918**. The story starts out in Europe and talks about his family and how he interacted with them and what started his interests in inventing gadgets. He writes about his fears, interests and personal achievements he made growing up.  He leads us up to how he eventually makes it to America and the inventions and achievements he made while living in America. This book was very short. He had some interesting details about himself. He tells the story of his experience and his work with Edison. He offers some very insightful feelings about our future and how he feels his inventions can help humanity.

16.	 (Published 1922) [* My Life and Work](https://www.audible.com/pd/My-Life-and-Work-Audiobook/B078897F8S?qid=1616474882&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=J6D4TMT8ERM1GYJP50S2) by [Henry Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford) – This book spans the era of **1863-1921**. In this book Henry Ford talks about the efficiency of mass production just like Ulysses S. Grant talked about war strategies in the civil war. There are many details about his industrial philosophy and how it can shape how we will work for years to come. There are theories of what our purposes in life are. Chapters 16 – 20 were a direct punch of wisdom about human behavior. He shares his philosophies about work and the meaning of life that are applicable today. Henry Ford is open about his racism against Jewish people and he talks about his anti-Semitic publication that he distributed through his businesses.

17.	 (Published 1929) [A Room of One’s Own](https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Room-of-Ones-Own-Audiobook/B005FY6G8Q?qid=1616475179&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=5MV10WB5D6A6RPGQDA8B) by [Virginia Woolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Woolf) – This is an important book although not from an American writer it was surely influential for women writers. It focuses on women’s rights and the lack of women’s voices throughout literature predating the 19th century. She puts the importance on the ability to earn enough money to afford the time to write. She writes about her influences and poets who inspired her.

18.	 (Published 1929) [A Farewell to Arms](https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Farewell-to-Arms-Audiobook/B002V5CSG6?qid=1616475283&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=SF2DQJET01KGEC6822CN) by [Ernest Hemingway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway) – This story takes place in **1918** about an American serving in the Italian army during World War I. Hemingway’s dialog is direct, repetitive, basic and American. I figure he inspired all the modern American writers since being published. He brings a dirty sense of humor, does a nice job describing a character that is going with the flow, and pointing out things he doesn't like about the war with moments of perfect imagery. It is a work of fiction but also loosely based on Hemingway’s own experiences in the war. It’s been the first book I read in which a famous sports figure was mentioned and I was excited to see that popular sports had officially entered the minds of creative writers such as Hemingway.

<a name="sport"></a>

19.	(Published 1938) [Farewell to sport](https://www.audible.com/pd/Farewell-to-Sport-Audiobook/B00S6YMD02?qid=1616475343&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=XJT2NQJB9ZVA5D1ENX5P) by [Paul Gallico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gallico) – Obviously a fan of Hemingway this book doesn’t hold back to really talk about the phoniness in sports of that era and he also writes about our passion for sports and how sports are presented to the public. This is like the catcher in the rye for sports. The author is not afraid to burn bridges as he is set to retire and he plans to move on to start writing novels. The early chapters are based on popular athletes that are beloved in the era of the 1920’s to the late 1930’s. There is a great chapter on Babe Ruth and there is a heavy focus on the sport of boxing and the boxing stars of that era.  The later chapters dissects the philosophies, the people running things behind the scenes, unfair treatment of black athletes, the sex appeal marketing strategies, the exploitation of amateur college football players and a variety of feelings and emotions surrounding this wild wacky world we call sports. Never before or will we ever get such a close look into the sports world and peek behind the curtain of all aspects surrounding the sports industry. This book sets the tone for how we deal with our sports hero’s of today. There is a chapter about the difficulties of black athletes of that era and the hypocrisies of the people who controlled sports. He describes women sports in a male chauvinistic manner but also praises some of the best women athletes of that era. And a wonderfuly written indepth description of the beautifulness of the sport of baseball.

20.	(Published 1945) [Black Boy](https://www.audible.com/pd/Black-Boy-Audiobook/0063008610?qid=1616475430&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=4GP42968NKN1CXS7VRYX) by [Richard Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wright_(author)) – This book spans the era of **1910-1945**. The story is an autobiography of Richard Wright. The book mostly depicts life in Mississippi and the south and later it describes Richard's adult life in Chicago. He tells about the difficulties he faced relating to a strict religious family growing up without a father. The stressful unforgiving nature of trying to socialize with white people careful not to say or do the wrong thing. He describes his slow realization that his role in the south was doomed and he day dreams looking for answers and decides he needs to get away from Mississippi and try to make his way north. This is a goldmine of very well written dialog and vivid imagery that can plant the reader right there with him on his journey. Anyone that questions why things are they way they are and wants to discover more out of life than just doing the norm like everybody else can relate to this book. The particular tough life is powerfully and painfully describe in this true story of striving to overcome the odds.

(Published 1945) [The Egg and I](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Egg-and-I-Audiobook/B00YDHK9KW) by [Betty MacDonald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_MacDonald) – This book spans the era of **1907-1935**. The story is an autobiography of Betty MacDonald. The book starts out describing her early life growing up in Montana, but the majority of the story tells about her time living on a farm in the mountains on the Olympic Peninsula near Seattle, Washington. This was the first audio book that I had to slow down the speed of the audio to keep up with all the descriptive swirling sentences and imagery. There are some very amazing descriptions of town life and even the smells of the shops in this rural town and also the informative depictions of the towns people delivered with effortless humor. It was towards the end of the book that I realized how much it reminded me of Cannery Row by John Steinbeck and as it turns out both of these books were published in the same year in 1945. I wondered who had influenced who but it seems that both authors were just feeling this moment in time in the pacific north west.
