# Firsthand American History (audible books)

## This is a collection of audio books, majority are non-fiction

I wanted to take a look back on the beginning of what inspired the America I live in today. Instead of reading a text of American history written by somebody alive today I wanted to hear voices that wrote about the past while living in the past. It's like getting in a time machine and going as far back as 400 years ago when Pilgrims migrated to New England. Listening to dialog and conversations that happened over 100 years ago is fascinating. Each author often references their influences, their favorite books and favorite authors and it inspired me to do some more research to help me find more things to listen to.

## Pre-19th Century
<a name="plymouth"></a>

1. ![Of Plymouth Plantation cover image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/518LkoCXR6L._SL150_.jpg) (Published 1651) [* Of Plymouth Plantation](https://www.audible.com/pd/Of-Plymouth-Plantation-Audiobook/B07BYSWNBD) by [William Bradford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bradford_(governor)) – This book was recovered after it went missing around the time of the revolution it was found in England and finally published. It covers the era of **1608-1651**. Most of this book are letters written to British investors that expected the pilgrims to get settled and ship goods back to England. It describes relationships with Native Americans and the French settlers. There are descriptions of conflicts with how some of these early settlers behaved. Side notes such as sailors who wouldn’t share their barrels of beer with the pilgrims. The difficulties of planting crops and staying alive the first year are inspiring to hear. He tells the story of why they left England and took on the challenge of braving the dangerous trip to America.

2. ![The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin cover image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51NGbT6iPVL._SL150_.jpg) (Published 1791) [* The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Autobiography-of-Benjamin-Franklin-Audiobook/B002V1OIOU?qid=1616368914&sr=1-2&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_2&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=VGZXNFZMWPR5RZZTZT59) by [Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin) – This book is surprisingly easy to follow and written in a modern tone for the time in which it was written. It covers the era of **1706-1789**. Ben writes about the origins of his parents and their background. He has stories about writing for his brothers printing press company under a fake name. He tells a story about how he threw his drunkard friend off of a boat for not helping them row the boat. He tells us about his travels from his home down to New York City looking for work. He goes into to many details of the characters that he meets along the way, particularly his first boss he worked for as a printer assistant in Philadelphia. He describes his involvement with the British in the French and Indian war. He talks about his time living over seas. The first half of this book takes a pause and then there is two letters from curious minds that urge Ben to continue his life story. He has a chapter dedicated to the beginning of American currency. Great read.

3. ![Rights of Man cover image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51xBtFwtHaL._SL150_.jpg) (Published 1791) [* Rights of Man](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Rights-of-Man-Audiobook/B007CLZ1I6?qid=1649977177&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=P2680YX6ZB1SY5VD23HQ) by [Thomas Paine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine) – This book takes place in the era of **1788-1791** and depicts the cause and actions of the French Revolution. Paine writes this book in response the Edmund Burkes's pamphlet Reflections on the Revolution in France. Burke denounces the reasons for the french people to revolt against the ruling class. Paine writes this book as a response to Burke’s allegations against the revolutionaries by declaring if the rights of people are not respected then revolution by the people should be expected and one should not be surprised by the actions of the French people towards the ruling monarchy. Paine says many times in his lengthy well thought response that this should be a lesson to monarchies, that if you abuse the people they can and will revolt. This is a long book and it is written in a more classic style of prose making it challenging to follow. I would also recommend knowing the history of the French Revolution might help to follow along with this book. Paine writes of many critical figures of this time that you can follow along with such as Marquis de Lafayette and de Brienne finance minister to Louis XVI. Paine spends the first 3rd of the book describing how the people began to attack the french soldiers led by Victor de Broglie mentioning that one of the things that sparked the revolt to spring into action was when a commander hit an elderly man in the street, such a fascinating first-hand detail. In the second half of the book written a full year later to unpack more responses in defense of the French Revolution, Paine goes into a lengthy detailed description of the American Revolution, how the founding fathers created the constitution, and his admiration toward the government he helped to create. He spends much of his time describing how hereditary power is an unproductive system and how much better a government by and for the people is better than the abusive ways of the monarchies of the old world. Paine goes into the matter of global trade and how if one empire goes to war with another it affects all of us which is relative to what we are seeing now in Russia. In chapter 16 the final chapter Paine gives us a very brief summary of his life including a letter to him written by Geroge Washington in 1783. He tells us how he wishes to inspire England to form a similar government as the one he has helped create in America. Even though the subject of this book is mostly about monarchies of England and the french revolution it is relevant to my research of America on the basis of the aforementioned being inspired by The American revolution which was started by The Father of the American Revolution Thomas Paine. In the last two hours of the book Paine lays out the exact amount of taxes paid each year in England for the past 700 years and he questions why they have become so high in the last 200 years. He compares with pride the American taxes to Britain's taxes and makes a valid argument that the monarchies don't do any of the work and how the working class would be just fine and continue their work without the monarchy's help. Paine proposes a tax plan for the poor and children with a very thoughtful way to help the poor become educated and rise from poverty. Paine says by treating the poor with lower taxes or no taxes would help to avoid future revolutions. In Paine’s second argument it seems he wanted to lay out a way forward where there is more hope for the poor instead of burying them in taxes, taxes seems to be the most important thing of this era and what people spent most of their time thinking about. Paine relays a brief story of Wat Tylor who took a stand against the King's unjust taxes in the 1300s and says he was a hero of that time to try to keep taxes in check. Thomas Paine was an interesting character, this book was the second of his most famous 3 books, by reading about him on Wikipedia the whole evolution describe in his 3 main books is an important part of understanding American History.

4.	![Daniel Boone: The Life and Legend of an American Pioneer cover image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51rfYmcAW-L._SL150_.jpg) (Published 1992) [* Daniel Boone: The Life and Legend of an American Pioneer](https://www.audible.com/pd/Daniel-Boone-Audiobook/B002V0TINM?qid=1616435415&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=M37K31F4D9HABQRSS41X) by [John Mack Faragher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mack_Faragher) – I let this book slide because I ran out of credits and it was part of the free library and it covered the era of **1732-1820** which is what I was looking for. The author used some of Daniel Boone’s actual writings and stories from his close relatives. It's a slight parallel to Franklin’s life story he too was involved in the French and Indian war. This story digs deep into his relationships with Native Americans for whom he admired. Interesting tails of growing up in the 1740’s. This book describes a time of pioneers starting to go west and build out settlements in Kentucky, which was heavily maintained by the Indians, which kept most of the coastal settlers away. All the fighting over land ownership caused many battles with the Indians and trips to the court to have a judge hand out rights to the land. Boone is described as an introvert. This book includes adventurous stories about being kidnapped by Indians of the Kentucky territory. 

## Nineteenth Century

1.	(Published 1821) [The Memoir of Thomas Jefferson](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Memoir-of-Thomas-Jefferson-AmazonClassics-Edition-Audiobook/1713543753?qid=1616435648&sr=1-5&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_5&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=5E3ZKW8FQWVWFK3P67E3) by [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_jefferson) – This was not as easy to follow as Ben Franklin’s autobiography. It covers the era **1743-1790**. Perhaps using Franklins autobiography as a template he too writes about his family's origin. He talked about his teachers who inspired him growing up. He reads the entire declaration of independence with the edits and revisions included. He had an interesting story about taking a note from Ben Franklin while Ben was on his deathbed and he gave it to Ben’s grandson. Jefferson expected to see it get printed for public but had yet to ever see it again. I tried to research what happened there but info was limited.

<a name="trapper"></a>

2.	(Published 1914) [* Journal of A Trapper: 9 years in The Rocky Mountains, 1834-1843](https://www.audible.com/pd/Journal-of-a-Trapper-Audiobook/1094001171?qid=1616454645&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=DFKZWXA1F5FN2ZP573MS) by [Osborne Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Russell) – This book spans the era of **1834-1843**.  It’s a straightforward story of fur traders making their way west for work and there are some interesting encounters with Indians. It has many descriptions of different types of pioneers and their conversations. Escapes near death experiences out in the wild. He provides descriptions of food, drink and clothing styles of this time. How people interacted with one another. This book is similar to Mark Twains book called Roughing It.

3.	(Published 1852) [Uncle Tom’s Cabin](https://www.audible.com/pd/Uncle-Toms-Cabin-Audiobook/B00C5OC5KM?qid=1616454443&sr=1-2&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_2&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=ZG7TR596GERW6EHERYDY) by [Harriet Beecher Stowe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Beecher_Stowe) – A great description of how people talked to eachother at that time. There is so much interesting dialog. This story was inspired by a former slave Josiah Henson’s memoirs. The references in Uncle Tom’s Cabin describe the era of **1830-1849**. Digs deep into the hypocrisies of white American culture. A great description of the kindness of children who don’t see things the way their parents do. She tells a story about how slaves that were able to invent and engineer machines would be moved to mindless labor out of spite. Stories of how slave children are often separated from their mothers. I was inspired to read this because it’s been said to have help start the war to end slavery. This book combined with 12 years a slave had to have ignited the move to abolish slavery for good.

4. (Published 1853) [* 12 Years a Slave](https://www.audible.com/pd/Twelve-Years-a-Slave-Audiobook/B00EZSV37C?qid=1616453153&sr=1-4&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_4&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=HAY4G07RZ46NJM5BFMT0) by [Solomon Northup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Northup) – This book spans the era of **1841-1853**.  This is a powerful book. While reading it I thought this must have inspired the civil war because it was such an awful experience for someone to go through. This book is filled with so many details of the harsh life as a slave. It starts by Solomon describing his daily life and some details about where he's from and family background. He describes the ugly mean faces of the traffickers. He describes the brutal sadness of kids being taken away from their mothers. This book will put you right there in the experience that Solomon suffered through and it’s hard to read.
 

<a name="walden"></a>

5.	(Published 1854, 1849) [Walden / Civil Disobedience](https://www.audible.com/pd/Walden-and-On-the-Duty-of-Civil-Disobedience-Audiobook/B002V0LSG2?qid=1635541144&sr=1-7&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_7&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=BJS239Y3C6NXD6CMZYKW) by [Henry David Thoreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau) – This audible book is a combination of two separate literary works by Thoreau. One of the most famous American authors known, this is a great work of non-fiction about a man who prefers thinking for himself and avoiding the common trends of his time. This book spans the era of **1845-1847**. In Walden, Henry starts by letting the audience know why he has chosen a more isolated lifestyle instead of following the same type of career paths and adventures as his peers. He describes a slower-paced lifestyle and the power of building your own home with your bare hands and learning to do more things for yourself without relying on specialists. He has opinions about the burden of inheriting land to farm which seems to be what most of the people Henry knew were doing. He explains our attachment to things is sad to him and wonders why we don't burn our worthless objects and start anew as he sights some native American tribes do. He observes and describes nature and the routine habits and behaviors of the animals that visit his tiny home on the pond. He goes into great detail about his surroundings bringing the audience into his remote world. He describes some of his visitors and other reclusive types that he sees around the pond from time to time. He emphasizes a minimalist philosophy of his needs as far as food and comforts go and said if someone asked him for a glass of water he hands them a ladle to scoop water from the pond just as he does. It's clear Thoreau kicked away from New England civilization to embark on an experiment to explore how much does a person really need and Walden is the result and hypothesis of how much busy work we make for ourselves leading to an unfulfilling life. An early adapter to questioning why do we do the things we do when they can be done much simpler. He has brief feelings about the educational system of that time and it’s all fascinating to learn about. It’s no wonder he became as famous as he did for being brave enough to talk the talk and walk the walk even though some of his critics scoffed at his philosophies living in such a rustic and basic manner. In the second part, Henry describes an incident in where he was thrown in jail for refusing to pay a tax bill that he was said to owe. He has opinions about military service at the time America was waging war with Mexico and he mentions he feels he is too high born to even consider serving as a soldier. This may have implied he had the privilege to have such opinions and mentions that those that celebrate people who refuse to fight in unjust wars are celebrated by the same people who vote in favor of the wars. He wonders why more people don't stand up for things that just a small group of people in the government decide is something we need to do. He describes his time in the jail and his cellmate and the sounds of the town surrounding his holding cell which was in the center of town. He seems to take in such details because he was more familiar with being on the outside of town. Thoreau was a person who found pleasure in the quiet serene life almost banal but clearly, he found excitement in other ways and his studies found in these two writings can certainly help us think today rather than just following. Something tells me if Henry David Thoreau went to a packed football game or sold-out Metallica concert it would give him an instant heart attack. That’s how much he valued silence, breathing, and allowing your mind to think deeply. Something struck me as interesting as life to him, in the 1840s was already becoming fast-paced to him and cars weren't even going to be invented for another 50 years after this was published, and it makes me think about all the stimulation humans are dealing with today. This book puts a lot of things into perspective in my opinion.

Mark twain heads west with his brother who gets a job in Nevada. Mark does a deep dive on the Mormons and their religion. And even heads to San Francisco and eventually he gets to Hawaii. He describes people and their language so very well in this book. If you want to go in a time machine to the old Wild West Mark Twain will take you there. Describes several types of people amazingly. Stories about friends playing pranks on him, fights, drunkards, explains why some people headed west with gold fever trying to get rich quick. He has a strange story at the very end about getting his ass kicked by I think his employer. Not sure if it was true I tried to research it but could not find more about it.

7.	(Published 1873) [* Bound To Rise](https://www.audible.com/pd/Bound-to-Rise-Or-Up-the-Ladder-Audiobook/B004HLZU3A?qid=1627769491&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=Y5FW8DWXPKE3ZX72PVQF) by [Horatio Alger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Alger) – This book spans the era of **1870-1872**. This story is about a poor working family that is faced with a dilemma, which then forces the oldest son to leave behind his education to help earn more money for his family. The narrator follows the boy as he comes across a variety of characters. This author's target audience is young adults therefore its a very clearly written and easy to follow. I mainly wanted to study the vernacular of this time and the interests of the characters to get a feel how people behaved from long ago rural America and this book does a great job providing that. I found this book because Upton Sinclair in King Coal referenced Horatio Alger. It's included with an audible membership and it's short sweet and to the point. The moral of this story is to do the right thing work hard and in time you can solve your problems, you just need to stay on the right path if you want to succeed. I could see how Horatio must have inspired many authors, play writes and screen play writers that came after him. A nice little story indeed. It makes me wonder now who inspired Horatio?

(Published 1929) [Nine Years Among the Indians, 1870-1879](https://www.audible.com/pd/Nine-Years-Among-the-Indians-1870-1879-Audiobook/1541445090?qid=1616455213&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=DCZMSA1QZ1FR61F0EDKM) by [Herman Lehmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Lehmann) – This book spans the era of **1870-1879**. It’s a fascinating story of an 11-year-old boy and his younger brother kidnapped by Apache Indians in Texas. The narrator, the man who was kidnapped as a boy, tells in great detail of the many hardships and harsh treatment by the Apache Indians. The Apache Indians raised the boy as if he is from their family. He has many close calls with death and eventually identifies as a Native American and learns how to get along in their world. I like this story very much, it is very entertaining and it is as close as you can get to see how a real American Indian tribe lived in the nature and their customs and brutal punishments to those who dare not follow their rules. The Apache Indians had particular eating habits that most people were not used to and the author has a lot of stories about the Native American cuisine. Many stories of the type of people they would run into in the wild and fights with other Indian tribes. This young man became quite skilled with the bow and amazingly he ended up living with both the Apache and the then eventually the Comanche tribe.

9.	(Published 1882) [* The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Authentic-Life-of-Billy-the-Kid-Audiobook/B002V8L3EG?qid=1632346472&sr=1-2&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_2&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=2X9XHZR43M36V8JJPXQ0) by [Pat Garrett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Garrett) – This book spans the era of **1859-1881**. This is a story about the legendary outlaw Henry McCarty also known as William H. Bonney. It takes place mostly in Lincoln County, New Mexico, and some in Arizona. Pat Garrett writes about his subject with great admiration in great detail of the full life of Billy The Kid. Pat writes the main reasons that he wanted to write this biography and about his chase and eventual capture of The Kid was because there had been too many false allegations made by other publications and through gossip and he wanted to set the record straight. Pat had respect for Billy as you can tell by how much he puts into talking about Billy's life and he figures Billy only killed people who crossed him first and if his back was against the wall he killed to save his own life. Pat seemed to respect the game of capturing his prisoner and he had the “it’s either him or me” mentality. There are great descriptions of the way people talked back then and Billy's friendships and how he would never back down from a challenge. Most of the killings by Billy the kid seem to be to avenge a friend’s (also employer) death which is described in this book. The book describes how in the wake of John Tunstall’s death, over a debt owed, Billy joined The Regulators and then the Lincoln County war had begun. The fact that this book was so wonderfully documented is the reason we still talk about Billy The Kid. I had fun researching the names mentioned in the book and was able to find photographs of them. This audible version is not of great quality but based on his content perhaps it’s best that way. A great dive into the rustic American wild west and the old gunfighting shootouts, hold on to your hat.

Watkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_R._Watkins) – This book spans the entire length of the Civil War **1861-1865**. In this book the author writes about his experience as a private soldier in the Tennessee first regiment for the confederate army of the south. This is a candid look at the roles of all soldiers, colonels, and generals and the rigid military hierarchy and harsh life especially for a private solider whom are the lowest rank in the army. This is an action packed description of most of the major battles of the civil war such as Shiloh. This book is not for the uneasy stomach as there are vivid descriptions of casualties and cruel punishments for deserters of the confederate army. The writing style is impressive for the time in which it was written and very easy to follow. The author offers strong feelings about the treatment of the private soldier and shares many stories of the human emotional side of the confusing relationship of civilians caught in the cross fire as well as sometimes the casual nature of socializing with the enemy when the fighting was over for the day. It's a mind-boggling story of how anyone could be involved in so many battles and live to tell the tale years later. I like this story of the war more than Grant's book written 3 years later. This version of the war shares more of the shameful dificult decisions made by the confederate generals and this book is shorter with more more compact direct descriptions of the cruelty of battle with fewer obsessions on strategy. This is a page-turner and offers an amazing look at how people lived and talked in the mid 19th century and a close look at the perspective of these young men during a horrible time in history.

Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant) – This book spans the era of **1822-1885**. The majority of the book is very detailed descriptions of each battle he was involved in during the civil war. He starts by telling a story about getting a raw deal by buying a wild horse and was embarrassed by it. He offers some insight about how and why the war started and the moments that led up to the conflict. Talked about getting hospitality from civilians in the south even though they were enemies. He made many points that if not for bad commands they could have ended the war sooner. He describes interesting thoughts about the press of the time and some of the issues he had with them. The final chapters of the book were very engaging up to the very end and of course he shares his memories of President Lincoln and some of their conversations.

This is a very up close and personal description of the 19th century immigrant families some of which were on the rise with hard work and saving every penny and some struggling to find any daylight. Riis unearths a lifetime lived long before the reader of today, covering the full spectrum of the New York City working classes describing each nationality and their relationships with each other speaking directly without hesitation of the possibility of insulting his audience with what might seem like stereotypes that Riis observed first-hand. There is a chapter of different types of gangs and how they conducted their business in the lower eastside of Manhattan. He tells of the harsh living conditions inside small apartments that are in poor condition neglected by landlords. He speaks of the industry of some of the immigrants and the short coming and exploitation of other groups. Its good that Riis wrote with such clarity as it must have shed light on a situation that would just get worse if nothing was done. People living in rural areas would have had no idea this was going on if not for this book. Riis addresses the hardships of the women and how they were unfairly paid compared to the men. He writes about the youth and how easily they can fall into the wrong hands while parents, if still alive, have no time to watch them. He breaks down the higher cost of rent for black Americans versus what white European immigrants were expected to pay. An amazing look at the goings on of New York City people of a time just after the civil war had ended. Riis also a photographer really describes every square inch and emotions of a time long ago. I could spend a good portion of my day googleing all the awe inspiring pictures that Jacob Riis took of this important subject. For history junkies this is both a gift and it is depressing knowing what some of these people went through and the helplessness they struggled with. Riis really just wanted to make their situation better and help structure city life for the better heading into the 20th century. He inspired better living and tenant rights for the modern working class families of the American cities of the 20th century.

The author paints a picture of the behavior of the wealthy some of which is observational of his own time on earth and partly what he’s learned from his research of the past. Veblen writes his opinions as if he's an alien from another planet observing the human race and their constructs of the hierarchy of wealth and class. C. Wright Mills who references this book and shares his opions about Veblen's theory in The Power Elite led me to read this book. Veblen writes his opinions from more of a scientific perspective of feelings and entitlements whereas C. Wright Mills mentions the actual names and old wealthy families Veblen does not mention any names or families at all. He's writing about wealth and class more like animal behavior when you put a bunch of money here the creature does this. This book was famous for "conspicuous consumption" which I translated to mean showing off your wealth in public without embarrassment. He writes in an old elegant style and I took some pauses to look up the definition of words that aren't commonly used today which was fun. This is not the most exciting book but it's a noble and interesting look at how humans view wealth and what is the expected behavior of the haves and have not’s.

This book is about a young woman's life in the American south. The book starts out by painting a picture of a husband and wife and their kids with vivid descriptions of their day-to-day dress and interests. I wanted to find a book with specific thoughts and feelings from people living in the southern part of America in the 19th century. This was helpful to get an idea of what people were thinking about in those days I like to know what kind of character and values are desired. Surely this book helped set the tone and inspire The House of Mirth by Edith Wharton. Both of these fictional novels had a similar main character and told a story about a woman’s life at the end of the Victorian era.

Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booker_T._Washington) – This autobiography spans the time of **1856-1900**. Booker T. Washington has a lot of wisdom in his story. He focuses on getting an education to raise himself up, but not just getting the education but the right kind of education and skills that would be desired. He starts his story born into slavery and worked his way up through education. He writes about if you can’t afford something making it with your hands will teach you a valuable lesson. He has stories about teaching Native Americans and then spent most of his life building schools in Tuskegee, Alabama. He has rich stories of his teachers and students. He talks about the people who helped him along the way. Towards the end of the book he talks about a big speech he made in Atlanta and the importance of bringing the north and south together. He had lots of generous support from the north and the south to help build his school. He and his students built the school with their own hands. They laid the brick before they opened their books. Plenty of great details such as becoming great and skilled at something. I was inspired by his clear basic descriptions of how to live life. A natural born leader. He goes into the detail of how nervous he would get before his big speeches. He had great stories of staying with families in the south when he first arrived.

This is a story about De Bois looking for work as a teacher in Tennessee and eventually finding a job as a teacher. He talks about the southern struggle and the difficulty in farm life and making enough money to move up in the world. He has poetic prose in his writing. His chapters are titled which makes the story easy to consume from chapter to chapter and he offers quotes from his inspirations to start each chapter. He talks about black leaders of the past such as Booker T. Washington. He has updates on some of his students and what became of them as they grew up.

This is a fictional story written by a woman author and the main character is a young 20 something woman. I wanted to get the perspective of a woman about how people behaved and what was important to the people of this era. After listening to the opinions and facts of the working class it was a contrast to shift into a story of the wealthy class at the turn of the century and the difficulties fitting into high society and finding a husband or wife to marry. The problems in this culture were petty and not as serious as the struggles of the poor people of the south but still problems to find a way to be apart of something for survival is the struggle described in this story. There are good descriptions of how wealthy people spent their money and how they valued it at the turn of the century.

This book delivers exactly what its title says. The son of Scottish immigrants who arrived in New Orleans in 1822. The author briefly describes how his family and a group of friends decided to leave Scottland to America and eventually settled in St Louis. The bulk of this wild adventurous tale mostly takes place in the era of 1840-1860 ending with a quick wrap up of his later years but what a full life the author paints for us in this great depiction of American history through the eyes of a fur trader making his way through the wild west. His health and thirst for adventure led him to join a group of fur traders that thought of him as a college kid but he quickly learned to dress the part. He gets into the detail about how he was taught the best way to hunt and kill a bear and he relays this to the listener in a way that I realized he's talking to an audience from a long-ago time in which this type of bear killing knowledge would be a great advantage to them and that’s the type of realism that can transport me smack dab into the reality of this book. There are different sets of rules in the life of fur traders living off the land most of which they were either welcomed or snarled at by certain groups of Indians. There are many descriptions of these run-ins each time these trappers found a new place to camp. The hostile Indian tribes he describes as “war parties” who didn't want any peace with the fur traders and he says if the traditional offer to share a smoke was declined they knew they would have to be ready for a fight later. He explains the foolish people who did not heed these warnings were the easy targets for hostile war parties but the fur traders were not to be trifled with as the author writes about their many battles with the Blackfeet Indians. He mentions that the Shoshone Indians were happy to have them when the fur traders entered their territory and they even fought together if their horses were stolen in the night. There is very descriptive language about scalping the enemy and how scalps were used for trade and such. The author describes how handy it was that he learned how to sign (Indian sign language) almost as well as the native Americans and that he was praised for how well he knew this skill. This book is an unbelievable description of a rough life lived and it seems unlikely most could survive this journey. It’s amazing how much has changed since this time. It was a real pleasure to live life with these trappers as they carved out a living during the great migration west in the 1800s.

This story takes place in Chicago and the main characters are Lithuanian immigrants. This tells the story of the industrial explosion and the treatment of the working class. The descriptions of the brutal work and the dangers of working in a meat packing factory are like nothing I've heard before. Upton explains the many ways these immigrants were taken advantage of by swindlers and as we follow our main character Jurgis he grows to understand how he'll need to stand up for his rights. There are great stories about what it was like to spend time in prison in the early 20th century. You will really get a feel of what it would be like if you just arrived in America with high hopes only to learn the many schemes and pitfalls along the way. This is a great description of how the social classes interacted with each other in these early days. There is some unbelievable dialog that will have your jaw on the floor in amazement how casual it was and how relative to our times today. This story is important because its the kind of information that you might have never heard about if Upton Sinclair didn't take the time to write about it. It also may have created better regulations for how American products are manufactured and to help create humane treatment of employees and rights for workers. Most importantly this story is so well written it will put you right into that time as if you traveled back in time.

The theme of this book is the author’s thoughts about the education he received and the education needed for the future to come.  The story digs deep into the education he received from people who taught him their outdated education because that’s what they were taught. He never seems satisfied with learning outdated education because it doesn’t serve him in a rapidly changing world. His prose is very elegant rather than specific and direct. Starting from his birth he breaks each chapter into chunks of years. He is the grandson and great grandson of former presidents of the United States. He did a lot of his education abroad. He pays attention to social behavior and has lots of opinions about differences between Americans and British and Europeans. He references the history of Rome and compares similarities to the happenings of his time in the 19th century. Henry Adams drops so many names in this book it will create a fun task to google all the people he talks about and send you into some lovely rabbit holes. He really gets to the core of how people lived in the 19th century and social games people played especially people involved in politics.

7.	 (Published 1917) [* King Coal](https://www.audible.com/pd/King-Coal-Audiobook/B00MFUZAEE) by [Upton Sinclair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upton_Sinclair) – This story spans the era of **1913-1914**. Upton tells a yet another story about the working people's struggle to earn fare wages and humane working conditions. Just like when Upton took on the meat packing industry and landlords taking advantage of working class immigrants in The Jungle in this book he takes a crack at the coal mining industry. Although a fictional novel Upton draws upon real life stories and does some investigating for added realism to his story about coal mining. This book has a diverse cast of immigrants from Europe and Asia. Upton narrates this as a concerned citizen and breaks down how the coalminers rank themselves and depict a hierarchy of the various nationalities of the coalmining camps. Upton is trying to shed light on the gross mistreatment of the workers who are bossed by cruel heavy-handed threats and the owners of the coalmines whom hardly pay attention to the awful working conditions. What’s most depressing is the danger of the work and to what lengths those in position of power will go to to preserve their profit margins. The narrator goes into deep dives about the threat union organizers plagued the mind of the coal-mining bosses and using political power to make sure the bosses of the mines maintained power. There was a tragic real-life standoff in Colorado in 1913 over striking coal miners and some workers were killed in the standoff which inspired Upton to write this novel. Upton Sinclair uncovers some more ugly truths about advantageous business owners exploiting those desperate for work. I never heard or knew about these sad stories before reading Upton Sinclair's work and I think he's a very important scriber of this harsh era for the working classes and he should be appreciated for that.

The story starts out in Europe and talks about his family and how he interacted with them and what started his interests in inventing gadgets. He writes about his fears, interests and personal achievements he made growing up.  He leads us up to how he eventually makes it to America and the inventions and achievements he made while living in America. This book was very short. He had some interesting details about himself. He tells the story of his experience and his work with Edison. He offers some very insightful feelings about our future and how he feels his inventions can help humanity.

Scott Fitzgerald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Scott_Fitzgerald) – This novel takes place in the era of **1900-1919**. It follows a young man that is coming of age as he struggles to understand his relationships with women and his status among his peers. The main character feels uncomfortable with the norm and what’s expected he pushes back on authority and the looming doom of WWI. He finds wisdom in his mom's new husband who helps him understand himself and explain the new pressures his generation is facing heading toward the nineteen twenties. I decided to read this book because Frederick Lewis Allen referenced it in Only Yesterday published in 1931. It's a good description of the informal relationships between young men and women than there had been in the high moral expectations of the past. This story had a very familiar feel to the famous Catcher in The Rye and I'd feel foolish if I'd believe that this book didn't directly influence the power of Salinger's masterpiece. This book flows through many characters and scenes but there are some very wonderful chunks in here to teach the reader how things were in America on the cusp of the post war 20's.

In this book Henry Ford talks about the efficiency of mass production just like Ulysses S. Grant talked about war strategies in the civil war. There are many details about his industrial philosophy and how it can shape how we will work for years to come. There are theories of what our purposes in life are. Chapters 16 – 20 were a direct punch of wisdom about human behavior. He shares his philosophies about work and the meaning of life that are applicable today. Henry Ford is open about his racism against Jewish people and he talks about his anti-Semitic publication that he distributed through his businesses.

It focuses on women’s rights and the lack of women’s voices throughout literature predating the 19th century. She puts the importance on the ability to earn enough money to afford the time to write. She writes about her influences and poets who inspired her.

Hemingway’s dialog is direct, repetitive, basic and American. I figure he inspired all the modern American writers since being published. He brings a dirty sense of humor, does a nice job describing a character that is going with the flow, and pointing out things he doesn't like about the war with moments of perfect imagery. It is a work of fiction but also loosely based on Hemingway’s own experiences in the war. It’s been the first book I read in which a famous sports figure was mentioned and I was excited to see that popular sports had officially entered the minds of creative writers such as Hemingway.

If you ever wanted to take a deep dive into the roaring 20's this book does the job. This is wonderfully written with more details and names than I could possibly find time to Google. It describes the big crimes, presidential scandals, popular games, the red scare, the economy boom and then eventual bust. He pinpoints the biggest stories that happened in this era. There was so much I never knew before reading this book and it can really help you learn about the modern culture we enjoy today. There is fascinating minutia such as the rising and lowering of women’s dresses with the trends in fashion and the promiscuity of the youth. There is a chapter of the counter culture led by H.L. Mencken and the bohemians that surely inspired the more famous counter culture of the 40's and 50's led by beatniks such as Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs which are household names today. This is a must read for history junkies there is so much to absorb in this book.

This is like the catcher in the rye for sports. The author is not afraid to burn bridges as he is set to retire and he plans to move on to start writing novels. The early chapters are based on popular athletes that are beloved in the era of the **1920s** to the late **1930s**. There is a great chapter on Babe Ruth and there is a heavy focus on the sport of boxing and the boxing stars of that era.  The later chapters dissects the philosophies, the people running things behind the scenes, unfair treatment of black athletes, the sex appeal marketing strategies, the exploitation of amateur college football players and a variety of feelings and emotions surrounding this wild wacky world we call sports. Never before or will we ever get such a close look into the sports world and peek behind the curtain of all aspects surrounding the sports industry. This book sets the tone for how we deal with our sports hero’s of today. There is a chapter about the difficulties of black athletes of that era and the hypocrisies of the people who controlled sports. He describes women sports in a male chauvinistic manner but also praises some of the best women athletes of that era. And a wonderfuly written indepth description of the beautifulness of the sport of baseball.

Cain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_M._Cain) – This book spans the era of the **1930s** and takes place in Glendale a suburb of Los Angeles County. I was looking for books about Los Angeles and this was one of the included titles available and although a fictional novel I still can get the idea of the surroundings and language of the time. The story tells about a marriage that is ending and the mother of two must find a way to make a living to pay the morgage as she navigates the new challenges that pop up. It's great to hear such raw language and descriptions about realtionships from a time when my grandparents were children and to hear about the visual terrain of an area that I would end up moving to 60 years after this book was published. The character of men and the percieved character of men from that time is interesting to hear about. As so much time goes by its fun to see how many similarities are still prevalent today but of course books such as this is how we can learn and try not to repeat the same mistakes.

The story is an autobiography of Richard Wright. The book mostly depicts life in Mississippi and the south and later it describes Richard's adult life in Chicago. He tells about the difficulties he faced relating to a strict religious family growing up without a father. The stressful unforgiving nature of trying to socialize with white people careful not to say or do the wrong thing. He describes his slow realization that his role in the south was doomed and he day dreams looking for answers and decides he needs to get away from Mississippi and try to make his way north. This is a goldmine of very well written dialog and vivid imagery that can plant the reader right there with him on his journey. Anyone that questions why things are the way they are and wants to discover more out of life than just doing the norm like everybody else can relate to this book. The particular tough life is powerfully and painfully describe in this true story of striving to overcome the odds. He has amazing story of his love for writing stories from his imagination as a boy and then he tells about how he escaped through books as he grew older and uncovered a whole new world of people who were curious about the world around just like he was and he lists his favorite books from that time. Richard has unabashing story of the communist parties and radicals that were current in the late 1920's and early 30's in Chicago.

The story is an autobiography of Betty MacDonald. The book starts out describing her early life growing up in Montana, but the majority of the story tells about her time living on a farm in the mountains on the Olympic Peninsula near Seattle, Washington. This was the first audio book that I had to slow down the speed of the audio to keep up with all the descriptive swirling sentences and imagery. There are some very amazing descriptions of town life and even the smells of the shops in this rural town and also the informative depictions of the towns people delivered with effortless humor. It was towards the end of the book that I realized how much it reminded me of Cannery Row by John Steinbeck and as it turns out both of these books were published in the same year in 1945. I wondered who had influenced whom but it seems that both authors were just feeling this moment in time in the pacific north west.

Wright Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Wright_Mills) – This story spans the era of **1865-1955**. This book is trying to define a group of individuals that make up the American power elite and how these people become powerful and make big decisions that have massive affects on everybody who lives in America and around the world. This book starts out a little slow taking its time to describe who are the power elite and what is the power elite. Then the author writes about the difference between new wealth compared to old wealth of these times. I had to pause often to google all the wealthy powerful people he mentions. Mills has a philosophy of how the wealthy became wealthy. He describes many stats of the wealthy that is hard to keep up with for example the amount of millionaires in 1865 vs the amount of millionaires in 1890 and the percentage of wealthy people who graduated from college in 1890 compared to the wealthy in 1950. A deep dive on how many wealthy came from modest working class families in 1865 vs the amount in 1950. He talks of the difficulties to get anywhere near the amount of the wealth of the power elite by just saving up a yearly salary. This book takes a very interesting look at how America's economy functions and the relationship between social classes. The author mentions and quotes all the attempts to explain wealth in America before he took a crack at it in 1956. There is an enlighting chapter about how the power elite can obviously use the media to push along agendas that will benefit the wealthy. There is much to learn by reading this but you have to pay close attention as the author uses an elegant writing style with lots of big words.

I like this book because it deals with a man who has failed at his acting career which has stunted his growth toward building a stable career. It's a very relatable American story for those who dream big but miss and now have trouble dealing with the reality of their life. The father of the main character resembles the stable figure who worked hard and became a respected doctor. The father uses his philosophy to live a simpler life with attainable goals to mock his son and his childish habits. The son is begging to be understood but the father seems to want to be left alone so he can enjoy the few years he has left, and would prefer not to be interrupted by his son’s self-inflicted problems. This was only the second book I chose to read from the fascinating decade of the 1950s and I think it's interesting because it felt like a modern story about a millennial, it's nice to know people weren't so practical from an era that seemed so clean-cut and structured. It is nice to see there were also chaotic lives being led by people with a strong father figure to look up to. This story is very well written and I think an important cautionary tale of living a free American life and where life might take you. It has the same tone as F. Scott Fitzgerald and JD Salinger about human relationships, sad truth, and comedy.

Dick writes about his early life growing up in St. Louis and his athletic achievements on his high school track team. He writes about how he developed his humor to hide insecurities and to enhance his social status among his peers. He explains how he used his charm several times throughout his life to make his life better and push his dreams forward to land his goals. Dick Gregory has many details of how he used his persuasion to not just help his life but to also help those in need of some wisdom to turn their lives around. He writes about his activism, support and speeches made during the civil rights marches in Mississippi. His opinions of race relations and class differences are very insightful. He has an intelligent philosophical idea of white and black people delivered with a touch of humor to tie it all together. He shared some comedy 101 about when some jokes will work and when they won't. I love this book because I feel like Dick Gregory's story and his comedy was missed by the millennial generation and he is not often mentioned by other comedians as a pioneer, which he most definitely is. If you are trying to come to grips with how people with differences can ever get along in this world pick up this book and travel back to the 40's 50's and 60's and see how those who came before us struggled with it.

I was craving non-fiction stories from southern California and this book fits the bill perfectly. There is some true crime, some insightful opinions of the type of Americans that want to come to California and the types of social bubbles they want to project once they arrive. Didion uses endearing descriptions to show the contrast of a young musician’s fame versus old Hollywood fame. When the southern California let downs and depression washes over you she describes the banal indifference so well. She takes us on a deep dive into the San Francisco hippy movement, which she describes as a chaotic time of disorder. She describes the 60's in a way that I never thought about before, she really helps you understand how loose and scary it all seemed for those people that prefer things be under control and prefer people that can be dependable. Didion brilliantly explains how she needed to be ok with disorder and to realize most of these kids were not being taught the rules of society. This is my first time reading any Joan Didion and excited to read more of her work. I don't find a lot of non-fiction describing California since I started my American history research and this book is an absolute gem and Joan Didion has become one of my favorite authors.

It is theorized, that changes to how humans live are speeding up faster than ever before and causing in some people traumatic stress. The book starts by showing the reader how humans lived practically the same for a large percentage of human history up to this monumental era of 1970 where a shift has happened compared to the time when humans started agriculture and the massive change that created back then. The author uses many excerpts from other writers about their observations of how quickly changes are happening compared to the past. He stresses the importance of being aware of this special time we are living in and not to just ignore it like some people particularly older generations tend to do while the youth embrace the change. He stated some insightful commentary on the multiple amounts of sub cults creating more chaos to a rapidly changing world. As for sub cults he describes a brief history of the hippies and what they evolved into. There is a chapter of how education will need to evolve to meet this ever-changing world, he writes a rather insightful observation about how we focus too much on the past but aren't taught how to envision the future. Thus he encourages reading more Sci-Fi books such as 2001 by Arthur C. Clarke. Future shock takes a thoughtful look at controlling our technology to keep it from spinning us out of control and over stimulating us. He proposes therapeutic suggestions for example perhaps for those of us who have trouble with all the technology advancements should look for communities purposely setup to recreate old styles of living such as the Amish communities live. This book was written in 1970 so reading it in 2021 was pretty interesting. I'd like to read more from this author and learn about how he viewed his predictions after living through them.

(Published 1971) [* The Tenants](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Tenants-Audiobook/B00NLNNE3S) by [Bernard Malamud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Malamud) – This story takes place in **1970s** Harlem, NY. The main character Harry is a writer living in a dilapidated apartment complex that is under renovation but Harry is holding out refusing to move so he can focus on his routine finishing his novel. Eventually, he discovers he has a neighbor diligently typing away on his novel as well, a black man named Willie Spearmint. They confront each other's racial and cultural differences throughout the story. This story specifically focusses on the discourse between black and Jewish cultures airing out stereotypical differences while bonding over the art and discipline of writing a novel and discovering an original voice. I found this book by reading The World of our Fathers which referenced notable Jewish American writers, Malamud was one of the main voices of this era. Malamud's most famous novel was The Natural which became a classic baseball movie starring Robert Redford. The Tenants was also adapted into a movie in 2006 starring Snoop Dog. Melamud writes the perspective through Harry, inspired by the tense relationship between the landlord and tenants of that time. The book takes a bit of a bipolar tone whether or not it was intended but perhaps mainly because Malamud is writing the voice of both characters the main in which he can personally relate to and the other he has to speculate a voice he thinks is closest to the truth of black cultural and the feelings towards Jewish people.

This book takes place in the era of **1945-1975** and tells a story about growing up as a child of Chinese immigrants in Stockton, California. I wanted to read a non-fictional story from an Asian American writer and this is a very interesting book with some effortless humor sprinkled in at times through Maxine’s honesty of her surroundings and the people she grew up with. It's a very candid story of her relationships growing up with her peers and her family’s personal struggles along with her confrontations with her parent’s expectations, particularly butting heads with her mom. I like this American story of how people adjust when leaving behind an old culture but still remembering fondly the stories that were told to them when they were young. Most of the story takes place in Stockton, California, some of this book talks about LA and the story talks about the family history from China. The sacrifices made to make a new life in America and still trying to hold on to the Chinese customs but the breaking away of the author to be herself is authored beautifully in this book. When learning about American history first hand it's important for me to hear all the voices that make up America and what their experiences were versus my own.

This book informs us early on of the hardships and social pressures aimed toward the Jewish people of Russia that created a desire to find new land to seek freedom from persecution and to find wealth, opportunity, and fair wages for their labors and skills. The author takes his time to describe the history of the Jewish people their various languages such as Yiddish and Hebrew their religious values and a vision of their environment in Russia in the mid 19th century. Howe describes leaving the small shtetls and entering larger European cities in Germany before embarking on the rough ride on filthy ships to Ellis Island. Most of the story takes place in New York City and the nerve-racking experiences dealing with rigorous inspections once arriving at Ellis Island. There are amazing details of all the difficulties of navigating through hustlers and passing examinations after arriving in America. Howe makes sure to set up the imagery of the problem and then describes the Jewish Americans that created organizations to help the newcomers to have an easier time and avoid being sent back to where they came from. Howe also describes the many differences and feelings of the more established German jews of this time versus the eastern European new arrivals with not much money to even get started in America. He reminds the reader of the scarcity of good-paying jobs and how hard it was for these immigrants referred to as green-horns to get ahead in their new world. This is a good book to get a history of how all immigrants who migrated here at this time and exactly what they went through as Howe shares excerpts from actual people living at this time and this is a must-read if you'd like to know how some families got started in America and how different it is today. Howe mentions so many figures of this time writers, millionaires, politicians, and Jewish radicals that I have to pause to research them as I listen. There is a lengthy chapter on Jewish radicalism and worker unions set up to fight back for the poor immigrants that were being mistreated and taken advantage of. Religious values played a big part in the Jewish people’s struggle to work hard and save up to be able to move away from the overcrowded tenement houses in Lower east-side NY. There are a few chapters on the political statistics and voting trends of the Jewish community and how candidates able to speak fluent Yiddish helped secure the Jewish vote. There are rags to riches stories of individuals that pioneered the movie industry out west such as The Warner Bros. The most-mentioned name in this book is Abraham Kahan, the voice for the Jewish working class. There is a lengthy portion of this book that discusses Yiddish literature, Yiddish poets and novel writers, and a backstory of their lives. There is a brief history of the Yiddish theater and actors at the turn of the century and then the story blends into modern Jewish voices of the latter half of the century. The author quotes Lenny Bruce and references Philip Roth and how the Jewish culture is represented in modern times. There is a chapter about famous Jewish artists that studied in France and brought their skills to contribute to American modern art. The book wraps up on a description Jewish suburban lifestyle as Jewish families that moved away from the cities and old tenements and the old Yiddish culture starts to disappear and Jewish traditions become less important to younger generations. This book had me open up several google tabs to search all the names that represented the eastern European culture that had strived to escape their role as manual laborers and eventually achieve the same success of their  allies, the German Jews. I started my American history research by reading an account of the pilgrims arriving in New England in the early 1600s and now I have an even clearer description of eastern European Jews arriving here in the 1800s by an author who lived in this era.

Herr captures the cruel visuals, feelings, and language of the American soldiers depicted with unflinching dialog. The language is particularly rough adding a type of realism that can put you into their boots. Scary helicopter rides, close calls, the constant bad feelings are how Herr manages his way through this unpleasant time in history. He describes the personalities of soldiers (Marines) and their commanding officers. Aside from all the exterior horrible things I grew up hearing about this war, this book takes you inside the mind of the people facing the action and how the fear drove some of these men crazy. The dialog of the soldiers in this book is so real it’s no wonder that Herr's remembrance of these conversations would eventually be used in such memorable classics about Vietnam such as Apocolypse Now and Full Metal Jacket. The feelings of the differences soldiers had toward the correspondents of the war describe the dynamic between the two and it creates a great narrative. The story tells how the correspondents were there to write about the war and photograph it but also they were in just as much danger as the soldiers were. There are graphic details of various war stories and rescue missions. A large part of the book does a deep look into the American strategy at Casaun and the bad vibe of that particular location. Herr mentions many references to the music of the time such as the Doors and Jimi Hendrix and draws a comparison of how art pop-culture style and the styles of the soldiers started to become one thing. He mentions many of his fellow correspondents that I had the fun task of researching them to see the photos that they captured during the Vietnam war. Herr writes about wrestling with his feelings of the soldiers that were killed that he got to know just moments before they'd be getting put into a body bag and how hard it was for him to shake the memories of them. Herr describes the sleepless nights and battles of PTSD that would not leave him alone. He admits as a journalist he wasn’t supposed to get so involved with feelings but that it was very tough for him to handle his emotions towards the dead, lost, and injured casualties of this war. During my American history first-hand research I've considered books about American wars such as Farwell to Arms describes WWI crucial to understand the government’s reasons to have these wars and the thoughts of the young Americans sent to fight them. How the people of this time feel about this war is an important part of the American story.

This story is the first in a series of related novels narrated by the main character Nathan Zuckerman. It describes the experience of a young up incoming writer working with an older established writer in the writer’s home and noticing the life and the emotions of the people around him. The book describes the pressure to write the truth while the main character’s family and friends hold his written words against him. Roth describes guilt instilled in a young writer that hears an earful for having the balls to write about his feelings about Jewish people and culture. The narrator is conflicted about why he should not be allowed to write about such taboo topics even though he is a Jewish man himself. I read this book because Roth was referenced in The World of Our Fathers. I have not read many books by Jewish American authors and I think that understanding the Jewish experience in America is a necessity to understand American history through first-hand experience.

Each chapter focuses on a group of people who migrated from a specific landmass from all the main continents of the world Europe: (Ireland, Germany (Amish, Jews)), Italy, Russia (Jews), Asia: (China, Japan), Africa and South America: (West Indies, Peurto Rico, Mexico). Sowell takes a thoughtful look at the reasons each ethnic group decided to make the treacherous journey across the ocean to settle in an unfamiliar land, he explains the conditions of the journey, the pitfalls and treatment upon arrival from which these new settlers struggled to overcome. Sowell writes about the hardships of working their way up and the difficulties of receiving fair treatment such as proper education, better-paying jobs, and getting representatives into politics. He articulates what each ethnic group specializes in, and what inherited characteristics helped them in these fields. Sowell obviously did his research and uses statistics to show unemployment, job types, percentages of single-parent families, average salaries not just by ethnicity but considering location, ethnic temperments, inventions, and contributions to things folded into American values that we all know and love today. For example beer, hotdogs and hamburgers are considered a very American staple of our food and beverage standards but it all came from the German immigrants which had settled in the Pennsylvania region and much of what is now considered middle America. One mainline Sowell keeps reminding the reader when explaining upward mobility of each ethnic group is the trend of an upper-class representative who has achieved great wealth tends to have had fewer children or no children at all  which ends the ability to pass on the skills which had helped them gain their wealth. For when this is so it resets accomplishments made toward the ethnic group and the skills are lost instead of being passed on through bloodlines. As Sowell points out on the contrary that poorer families tend to have many children and do not have skills of how to attain wealth to pass on. I’m not sure why Sowell focused on this point but it might be to give some answers to the question of why some members of a particular family may be stuck with earning lower class wages if never taught how to earn better wages for ones self. Sowell describes the subtle differences between sub groups within each ethnic group by the region from where they had come from, such as the compariable differences of Irish to the scotch-Irish, Italians from north Italy to Italians from southern Italy, blacks from the West Indies to the blacks who had been in America for hundreds of years. Sowell describes the issues these regional differences caused. He also points out that if a group of people from the same region had become acquainted in America, they dealt with people who just were just arriving with perhaps in a bit of a prickly manner. This book is going to open your mind way up to what makes up America and how long all these different cultures from far away places have been converging. It’s nice to hear the stories of triumph toward achieving their dreams. Sowell ends each chapter by listing out the names of notable people from each ethnicity which is helpful for me to find more books about American people of the past. It’s always fun to read the wikipedia page of these notable people and go into some fun rabbit holes. I think this is an important lesson to understand through generations removed how America started to populate the 50 states. Although Sowell did not experience this first-hand he references many writings from that time. [How The Other Half Lives by Jacob Riis](#riis) is a first-hand experience much about what Sowell writes if you’d like to take a closer look. I found this book when I saw a parody account on Twitter posting Thomas Sowell quotes and I decided to see if his books were available on audible. As it turns out he has many books “Included” in the audible library including this one.

(Published 1981) [Ain't I a Woman?](https://www.audible.com/pd/Aint-I-a-Woman-Audiobook/1977343309?qid=1647643214&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=K154TD1KK8XFVM1T6R52) by [bell hooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_hooks) – This book is a deep dive about the history of the progression of black women's voices, literature and the feminism movement through a span of time from **mid 19th century to late 20th century**. hooks points out that black women didn't just carry the burden of racism targetted against them but also the opression of sexism as well. hooks feels that when most people fight for the civil rights of black people they really mean for black men while black women's issues remain in the background and not seen as important. hooks argues that women rights are focused on white women's rights and that the feminist movement doesn't deal with black women's rights directly as a separate issue. She cleverly argues that it's completely overlooked that black women are fighting two issues, dealing with the negativety from whites towards black people but also sexism within the black communuity delivered toward them by shauvenistic black men. I think this is a book about fairness and to bring awarness to a group of women who's issues deserve a closer look and empathy. hooks mentions a bunch of names of progressive black women who spoke out and wrote books about black women's rights long ago such Anna Julia Cooper and Souljouner Truth. I had fun time learning about these brave women and have added their books to my reserch about the fabric of American society.

30.	(Published 1984) [Hacker: Heroes of The Computer Revolution](https://www.audible.com/pd/Hackers-Heroes-of-the-Computer-Revolution-Audiobook/B017RUZC4E?qid=1652480246&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=71V7167H9EE36JC6D6BJ) by [Steven Levy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Levy) – This book starts in Cambridge, Mass in the year **1958** and tells a profound history of a group of the earliest computer programmers. Levy describes the curious math and computer students that couldn't wait to get their hands on the massive million-dollar computer that ran on punch cards for instructions. Eventually, these students were granted access and they each took turns writing programs and challenged each other to write the same program using fewer lines of code. This is the beginning of independent hackers writing their own computer programs. It's surprising that even way back then the book discusses the interests of these individuals which included Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. It's fascinating to hear about how these hackers created the first well-known video game Space Wars and wrote programs for a Robotic arm to track the trajectory of a ping pong ball and catch it while in mid-air. These programmers mostly shared one very expensive computer that was the size of a living room. It's cool how they viewed the power of the computer and how it could help improve our lives. There are so many people involved in creating the hacker ethic that it is helpful to follow along with the Hackers Wikipedia page as you read. I think exploring how computer programming got started in America is an important thing to learn about how the move to programming computer technology helped shape the American society and its effects on the American culture. This book is a smooth read to listen to with a ton of fun factoids about how the hackers solved the problems of their time.

31.	(Published 1985) [* Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business](https://www.audible.com/pd/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Audiobook/B002V5ISZ6?qid=1643755418&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=T2MCWJYQKEBEMH47A6JD) by [Neil Postman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Postman) – This book is a theory of the power and evolution of mediums such as speech, typography, books, print ads, radio, and television. The bulk of the argument is about the immense power that television has over the world, specifically how it directly creates a culture in America. Postman sets out to point out the decline of typography and it being replaced by television and the effect it has on our public discourse. I found this book from a tweet by somebody I follow and it was perfect timing because I was looking for non-fiction in the 1980s and it is included in the audible membership. It reminded me of the book Futureshock in where both books describe the speeding up of industry and information and the consequences this might have on society. Postman does a good job setting up his theory by comparing Orwell's and Huxley's prophecies of the future of society and deciding which prophecy most describes present-day 1985. Postman writes he wouldn't mind the comparison to Marshall McLuhan's famous phrase "the medium is the message" as he continues to describe what a medium is and what's its purpose is and concludes his own phrase, “the medium is the metaphor”. He has many arguments about how television is image-based and it disrupts our public discourse once enjoyed by people of the past. He writes about how the invention of the telegraph has allowed decontextualized information to travel over vast spaces at incredible speed. There is an amazing chapter about the American history of typography starting from 1600's New England up to the transition of the telegraph and eventually print media with advertisements. How America went from hardly having any books printed here in the early 17th-century Postman describes the first newspapers and early American authors which had me researching pioneers such as Thomas Paine and finding so many more books to add to my American history research. Postman shows off his intelligence in this book using big philosophical words and theories. This is probably a book I'll need to listen to again to fully grasp all the information and things to pay attention to in the culture around me today. Postman is definitely trying to warn people to think about what they know and see and realize the source from which it comes from and the creators of such content may not have your best interest. I think this is an awesome book to read for the education of American culture. Much of the content I was raised on came from American television which is also watched around the world. The funny thing is that I grew up with a healthy dose of people telling me “tv will rot your brain” and that I should pick up a book and read instead which I agree is good advice but I also notice when typography was the main medium of its time the parents of that time had the same skeptical feelings about books as the parents of today have of tv. Postman makes an interesting point about political debates in a 19th-century culture people were prepared to sit through 7-hour debates versus present-day a politician who uses images and must look good on television. He sites people of the past had the capacity to sit and listen and understand complex sentences from a speech but in today’s culture, we could hardly be expected to have that much patience.

# Native American History (audible books)

I wanted to learn about the history of the Native Americans that inhabitted North American region. Although during my initial study of American History there are many references to American Indian tribes and their relationship with the european settlers but I want to hear about their history through their expereinces. I know the stories from the 19th century are very sad as many of the native tribes were moved off their land and killed in battle but I know there is a lot more to know that goes way back before the European explorers travled to America and I am very curious how they lived and got along amongst the various different American Indian tribes.

1. (Published 1970) [* Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West](https://www.audible.com/pd/Bury-My-Heart-at-Wounded-Knee-Audiobook/B002V9ZEA4?qid=1632348095&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=1VFFFF979WYQ295ET0XH) by [Dee Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dee_Brown_(writer)) – This book covers the era of **1860-1881**. It is a very brutally honest history about the American Indian tribes of the western part of America and how they were treated by the United States government. There are also some stories about the relationships of some tribes and their relationship with Mexicans as well. Each chapter covers an individual Native American tribe (for example Navajo, Sioux, and Apache to name a few) and their experiences. There are many battles detailed in this book some of which were won by the American Indians but most of the battles were won by the united states military (blue coats) by their advantage in numbers and modern weaponry. This book does not have many happy moments however there are times of peace and there are words of peace expressed by some of the tribal leaders towards the white man, but there seemed to be a need for the government to make Native Americans live like them which the Indians did not desire to. There are many famous names mentioned in this book such as Kit Carson, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, General Custar, Cochise, Geronimo and many more names which I had the pleasure to google and then I could see photographs of all the people mentioned in this book which helped me visualize the stories better. There is a wonderful chapter about Ely S. Parker who was a Native American Indian and served with President Grant in the civil war. Ely was later appointed Commissioner of Indian Affairs. In this 21 year span, the United States government obviously wanted to expand the new American-European population and have them settle in western America and they viewed the Indians as something in their way and wanted to relocate them off of their beloved land. And obviously, the Indians did not want to leave the land where they had success hunting and living off the land to be moved to an undesired part of the country which could cause all kinds of problems so there was bound to be battles and push back to these broken promises. It is suggested that some of the generals in charge of the US soldiers made up reasons to persuade the president to keep them in the west so that the soldiers could avoid the much more dangerous conflict by serving in the civil war. The United States government wanted to build railroads, headquarters, military posts and start building new towns for people to settle into and try to make them safe by showing a military presence and Dee Brown tells this head-shaking story without missing a thing.

# European History (audible books)

The history of Europe is an interesting topic because I can find a lot more books published in the 17th century. Getting a firsthand account of the foundations of what would eventually branch out and become America and the influences Europe has had had around the world will be an eye opening study for me.

1. (Published 1859) [* A Tale of Two Cities](https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Tale-of-Two-Cities-Audiobook/B0773Z4GB6?qid=1651867971&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=GJWNN8AEC4NT4TJ27ATJ) by [Charles Dickens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens) – This book is a historical novel about the events leading up to and the occurrences during the French Revolution. The story covers the era of **1775-1792**. The first part of the story starts off very slow, but Dickens is trying to carefully establish his main characters and show the egregious treatment of the working-class people by the aristocrats. Dickens narrates in 3rd person following Darnay his wife Lucie and her Farther Dr. Manet. Dickens was helped by Thomas Carlyle's novel and a few other books about the French revolution to help with language and historical events. Starting in 1775 the story wants to show the indifference the aristocrats had toward the struggle of the poor to make a living and eat well. As the story progresses he shows the uprising of the people (the republic) which eventually takes over the prisons and turns the tables on the aristocrats and immigrants which they blame for all the mistreatment. The republic is blinded by the movement and perhaps Dickens shows the heavy-handed punishment handed down to all including women and children was taken too far. I wanted to read this book after reading The Rights of Man by Thomas Paine so that I could get a better understanding of the French Revolution, what caused it, and what the results were. This book seems more character-driven but does offer the details and the feelings of the people of that time. Dickens was not alive during this period but just one generation removed so the stories of that time were still fresh. This book was difficult to follow and keep track of the characters, I recommend reading the Tale of Two Cities Wikipedia page and following the list of the character descriptions. I am more interested in the actual events of the revolution and not that interested in the drawn-out dialog and emotions of the characters as much but Dickens obviously was a superb writer and amazing at creating characters.
