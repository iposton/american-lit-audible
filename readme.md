# Firsthand American History (audible books)

## This is a collection of audio books, majority are non-fiction

I wanted to take a look back on the beginning of what inspired the America I live in today. Instead of reading a text of American history written by somebody alive today I wanted to hear voices that wrote about the past while living in the past. It's like getting in a time machine and going as far back as 400 years ago when Pilgrims migrated to New England. Listening to dialog and conversations that happened over 100 years ago is fascinating. Each author often references their influences, their favorite books and favorite authors and it inspired me to do some more research to help me find more things to listen to.

![Of Plymouth Plantation cover image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/518LkoCXR6L._SL150_.jpg) (Published 1651) [* Of Plymouth Plantation](https://www.audible.com/pd/Of-Plymouth-Plantation-Audiobook/B07BYSWNBD) by [William Bradford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bradford_(governor)) **Narrated by:** Matthew McAuliffe **Length:** 12 hrs and 20 mins **Rating:** 4.4 **Genre:** Autobiographical/History – This book was recovered after it went missing around the time of the revolution it was found in England and finally published. It covers the era of **1608-1651**. Most of this book are letters written to British investors that expected the pilgrims to get settled and ship goods back to England. It describes relationships with Native Americans and the French settlers. There are descriptions of conflicts with how some of these early settlers behaved. Side notes such as sailors who wouldn’t share their barrels of beer with the pilgrims. The difficulties of planting crops and staying alive the first year are inspiring to hear. He tells the story of why they left England and took on the challenge of braving the dangerous trip to America.

![The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin cover image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51NGbT6iPVL._SL150_.jpg) (Published 1791) [* The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Autobiography-of-Benjamin-Franklin-Audiobook/B002V1OIOU?qid=1616368914&sr=1-2&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_2&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=VGZXNFZMWPR5RZZTZT59) by [Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin) **Narrated by:**  **Length:**  hrs and  mins **Rating:**  **Genre:** Memoir/History – This book is surprisingly easy to follow and written in a modern tone for the time in which it was written. It covers the era of **1706-1789**. Ben writes about the origins of his parents and their background. He has stories about writing for his brothers printing press company under a fake name. He tells a story about how he threw his drunkard friend off of a boat for not helping them row the boat. He tells us about his travels from his home down to New York City looking for work. He goes into to many details of the characters that he meets along the way, particularly his first boss he worked for as a printer assistant in Philadelphia. He describes his involvement with the British in the French and Indian war. He talks about his time living over seas. The first half of this book takes a pause and then there is two letters from curious minds that urge Ben to continue his life story. He has a chapter dedicated to the beginning of American currency. Great read.

![Rights of Man cover image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51xBtFwtHaL._SL150_.jpg) (Published 1791) [* Rights of Man](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Rights-of-Man-Audiobook/B007CLZ1I6?qid=1649977177&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=P2680YX6ZB1SY5VD23HQ) by [Thomas Paine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine) **Narrated by:** Bernard Mayes
**Length:** 10 hrs and 12 mins **Rating:** 4.5 – This book takes place in the era of **1788-1791** and depicts the cause and actions of the French Revolution. Paine writes this book in response the Edmund Burkes's pamphlet Reflections on the Revolution in France. Burke denounces the reasons for the french people to revolt against the ruling class. Paine writes this book as a response to Burke’s allegations against the revolutionaries by declaring if the rights of people are not respected then revolution by the people should be expected and one should not be surprised by the actions of the French people towards the ruling monarchy. Paine says many times in his lengthy well thought response that this should be a lesson to monarchies, that if you abuse the people they can and will revolt. This is a long book and it is written in a more classic style of prose making it challenging to follow. I would also recommend knowing the history of the French Revolution might help to follow along with this book. Paine writes of many critical figures of this time that you can follow along with such as Marquis de Lafayette and de Brienne finance minister to Louis XVI. Paine spends the first 3rd of the book describing how the people began to attack the french soldiers led by Victor de Broglie mentioning that one of the things that sparked the revolt to spring into action was when a commander hit an elderly man in the street, such a fascinating first-hand detail. In the second half of the book written a full year later to unpack more responses in defense of the French Revolution, Paine goes into a lengthy detailed description of the American Revolution, how the founding fathers created the constitution, and his admiration toward the government he helped to create. He spends much of his time describing how hereditary power is an unproductive system and how much better a government by and for the people is better than the abusive ways of the monarchies of the old world. Paine goes into the matter of global trade and how if one empire goes to war with another it affects all of us which is relative to what we are seeing now in Russia. In chapter 16 the final chapter Paine gives us a very brief summary of his life including a letter to him written by Geroge Washington in 1783. He tells us how he wishes to inspire England to form a similar government as the one he has helped create in America. Even though the subject of this book is mostly about monarchies of England and the french revolution it is relevant to my research of America on the basis of the aforementioned being inspired by The American revolution which was started by The Father of the American Revolution Thomas Paine. In the last two hours of the book Paine lays out the exact amount of taxes paid each year in England for the past 700 years and he questions why they have become so high in the last 200 years. He compares with pride the American taxes to Britain's taxes and makes a valid argument that the monarchies don't do any of the work and how the working class would be just fine and continue their work without the monarchy's help. Paine proposes a tax plan for the poor and children with a very thoughtful way to help the poor become educated and rise from poverty. Paine says by treating the poor with lower taxes or no taxes would help to avoid future revolutions. In Paine’s second argument it seems he wanted to lay out a way forward where there is more hope for the poor instead of burying them in taxes, taxes seems to be the most important thing of this era and what people spent most of their time thinking about. Paine relays a brief story of [Wat Tyler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Tyler) who took a stand against the King's unjust taxes in the 1300s and says he was a hero of that time to try to keep taxes in check. Thomas Paine was an interesting character, this book was the second of his most famous 3 books, by reading about him on Wikipedia the whole evolution describe in his 3 main books is an important part of understanding American History. *- 4/21/22*

![Daniel Boone: The Life and Legend of an American Pioneer cover image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51rfYmcAW-L._SL150_.jpg) (Published 1992) [* Daniel Boone: The Life and Legend of an American Pioneer](https://www.audible.com/pd/Daniel-Boone-Audiobook/B002V0TINM?qid=1616435415&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=M37K31F4D9HABQRSS41X) by [John Mack Faragher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mack_Faragher) **Narrated by:** John Mack Faragher **Length:** 12 hrs and 56 mins **Rating:** 4.5 **Genre:** Biography/History – I let this book slide because I ran out of credits and it was part of the free library and it covered the era of **1732-1820** which is what I was looking for. The author used some of Daniel Boone’s actual writings and stories from his close relatives. It's a slight parallel to Franklin’s life story he too was involved in the French and Indian war. This story digs deep into his relationships with Native Americans for whom he admired. Interesting tails of growing up in the 1740’s. This book describes a time of pioneers starting to go west and build out settlements in Kentucky, which was heavily maintained by the Indians, which kept most of the coastal settlers away. All the fighting over land ownership caused many battles with the Indians and trips to the court to have a judge hand out rights to the land. Boone is described as an introvert. This book includes adventurous stories about being kidnapped by Indians of the Kentucky territory.

![The Memoir of Thomas Jefferson cover image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41UWcLjelSL._SL150_.jpg) (Published 1821) [The Memoir of Thomas Jefferson](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Memoir-of-Thomas-Jefferson-AmazonClassics-Edition-Audiobook/1713543753?qid=1616435648&sr=1-5&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_5&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=5E3ZKW8FQWVWFK3P67E3) by [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_jefferson) **Narrated by:** Christopher Lane **Length:** 7 hrs and 2 mins **Rating:** 4.3 **Genre:** Autobiography/History – This was not as easy to follow as Ben Franklin’s autobiography. It covers the era **1743-1790**. Perhaps using Franklins autobiography as a template he too writes about his family's origin. He talked about his teachers who inspired him growing up. He reads the entire declaration of independence with the edits and revisions included. He had an interesting story about taking a note from Ben Franklin while Ben was on his deathbed and he gave it to Ben’s grandson. Jefferson expected to see it get printed for public but had yet to ever see it again. I tried to research what happened there but info was limited.

It’s a straightforward story of fur traders making their way west for work and there are some interesting encounters with Indians. It has many descriptions of different types of pioneers and their conversations. Escapes near death experiences out in the wild. He provides descriptions of food, drink and clothing styles of this time. How people interacted with one another. This book is similar to Mark Twains book called Roughing It.

There is so much interesting dialog. This story was inspired by a former slave Josiah Henson’s memoirs. The references in Uncle Tom’s Cabin describe the era of **1830-1849**. Digs deep into the hypocrisies of white American culture. A great description of the kindness of children who don’t see things the way their parents do. She tells a story about how slaves that were able to invent and engineer machines would be moved to mindless labor out of spite. Stories of how slave children are often separated from their mothers. I was inspired to read this because it’s been said to have help start the war to end slavery. This book combined with 12 years a slave had to have ignited the move to abolish slavery for good.

This is a powerful book. While reading it I thought this must have inspired the civil war because it was such an awful experience for someone to go through. This book is filled with so many details of the harsh life as a slave. It starts by Solomon describing his daily life and some details about where he's from and family background. He describes the ugly mean faces of the traffickers. He describes the brutal sadness of kids being taken away from their mothers. This book will put you right there in the experience that Solomon suffered through and it’s hard to read.

![Walden / Civil Disobedience cover image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ArBuF86zL._SL150_.jpg) (Published 1854, 1849) [Walden / Civil Disobedience](https://www.audible.com/pd/Walden-and-On-the-Duty-of-Civil-Disobedience-Audiobook/B002V0LSG2?qid=1635541144&sr=1-7&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_7&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=BJS239Y3C6NXD6CMZYKW) by [Henry David Thoreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau) – This audible book is a combination of two separate literary works by Thoreau. One of the most famous American authors known, this is a great work of non-fiction about a man who prefers thinking for himself and avoiding the common trends of his time. This book spans the era of **1845-1847**. In Walden, Henry starts by letting the audience know why he has chosen a more isolated lifestyle instead of following the same type of career paths and adventures as his peers. He describes a slower-paced lifestyle and the power of building your own home with your bare hands and learning to do more things for yourself without relying on specialists. He has opinions about the burden of inheriting land to farm which seems to be what most of the people Henry knew were doing. He explains our attachment to things is sad to him and wonders why we don't burn our worthless objects and start anew as he sights some native American tribes do. He observes and describes nature and the routine habits and behaviors of the animals that visit his tiny home on the pond. He goes into great detail about his surroundings bringing the audience into his remote world. He describes some of his visitors and other reclusive types that he sees around the pond from time to time. He emphasizes a minimalist philosophy of his needs as far as food and comforts go and said if someone asked him for a glass of water he hands them a ladle to scoop water from the pond just as he does. It's clear Thoreau kicked away from New England civilization to embark on an experiment to explore how much does a person really need and Walden is the result and hypothesis of how much busy work we make for ourselves leading to an unfulfilling life. An early adapter to questioning why do we do the things we do when they can be done much simpler. He has brief feelings about the educational system of that time and it’s all fascinating to learn about. It’s no wonder he became as famous as he did for being brave enough to talk the talk and walk the walk even though some of his critics scoffed at his philosophies living in such a rustic and basic manner. In the second part, Henry describes an incident in where he was thrown in jail for refusing to pay a tax bill that he was said to owe. He has opinions about military service at the time America was waging war with Mexico and he mentions he feels he is too high born to even consider serving as a soldier. This may have implied he had the privilege to have such opinions and mentions that those that celebrate people who refuse to fight in unjust wars are celebrated by the same people who vote in favor of the wars. He wonders why more people don't stand up for things that just a small group of people in the government decide is something we need to do. He describes his time in the jail and his cellmate and the sounds of the town surrounding his holding cell which was in the center of town. He seems to take in such details because he was more familiar with being on the outside of town. Thoreau was a person who found pleasure in the quiet serene life almost banal but clearly, he found excitement in other ways and his studies found in these two writings can certainly help us think today rather than just following. Something tells me if Henry David Thoreau went to a packed football game or sold-out Metallica concert it would give him an instant heart attack. That’s how much he valued silence, breathing, and allowing your mind to think deeply. Something struck me as interesting as life to him, in the 1840s was already becoming fast-paced to him and cars weren't even going to be invented for another 50 years after this was published, and it makes me think about all the stimulation humans are dealing with today. This book puts a lot of things into perspective in my opinion.

Mark twain heads west with his brother who gets a job in Nevada. Mark does a deep dive on the Mormons and their religion. And even heads to San Francisco and eventually he gets to Hawaii. He describes people and their language so very well in this book. If you want to go in a time machine to the old Wild West Mark Twain will take you there. Describes several types of people amazingly. Stories about friends playing pranks on him, fights, drunkards, explains why some people headed west with gold fever trying to get rich quick. He has a strange story at the very end about getting his ass kicked by I think his employer. Not sure if it was true I tried to research it but could not find more about it.

![Bound To Rise cover image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51dXHsXpKTL._SL150_.jpg) (Published 1873) [* Bound To Rise](https://www.audible.com/pd/Bound-to-Rise-Or-Up-the-Ladder-Audiobook/B004HLZU3A?qid=1627769491&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=Y5FW8DWXPKE3ZX72PVQF) by [Horatio Alger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Alger) **Narrated by:** MacLeod Andrews
**Length:** 5 hrs and 32 mins **Rating:** 4.2 – This book spans the era of **1870-1872**. This story is about a poor working family that is faced with a dilemma, which then forces the oldest son to leave behind his education to help earn more money for his family. The narrator follows the boy as he comes across a variety of characters. This author's target audience is young adults therefore its a very clearly written and easy to follow. I mainly wanted to study the vernacular of this time and the interests of the characters to get a feel how people behaved from long ago rural America and this book does a great job providing that. I found this book because Upton Sinclair in King Coal referenced Horatio Alger. It's included with an audible membership and it's short sweet and to the point. The moral of this story is to do the right thing work hard and in time you can solve your problems, you just need to stay on the right path if you want to succeed. I could see how Horatio must have inspired many authors, play writes and screen play writers that came after him. A nice little story indeed. It makes me wonder now who inspired Horatio?

It’s a fascinating story of an 11-year-old boy and his younger brother kidnapped by Apache Indians in Texas. The narrator, the man who was kidnapped as a boy, tells in great detail of the many hardships and harsh treatment by the Apache Indians. The Apache Indians raised the boy as if he is from their family. He has many close calls with death and eventually identifies as a Native American and learns how to get along in their world. I like this story very much, it is very entertaining and it is as close as you can get to see how a real American Indian tribe lived in the nature and their customs and brutal punishments to those who dare not follow their rules. The Apache Indians had particular eating habits that most people were not used to and the author has a lot of stories about the Native American cuisine. Many stories of the type of people they would run into in the wild and fights with other Indian tribes. This young man became quite skilled with the bow and amazingly he ended up living with both the Apache and the then eventually the Comanche tribe.

![The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid cover image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ePzFXybLL._SL150_.jpg) (Published 1882) [* The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Authentic-Life-of-Billy-the-Kid-Audiobook/B002V8L3EG?qid=1632346472&sr=1-2&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_2&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=2X9XHZR43M36V8JJPXQ0) by [Pat Garrett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Garrett) – This book spans the era of **1859-1881**. This is a story about the legendary outlaw Henry McCarty also known as William H. Bonney. It takes place mostly in Lincoln County, New Mexico, and some in Arizona. Pat Garrett writes about his subject with great admiration in great detail of the full life of Billy The Kid. Pat writes the main reasons that he wanted to write this biography and about his chase and eventual capture of The Kid was because there had been too many false allegations made by other publications and through gossip and he wanted to set the record straight. Pat had respect for Billy as you can tell by how much he puts into talking about Billy's life and he figures Billy only killed people who crossed him first and if his back was against the wall he killed to save his own life. Pat seemed to respect the game of capturing his prisoner and he had the “it’s either him or me” mentality. There are great descriptions of the way people talked back then and Billy's friendships and how he would never back down from a challenge. Most of the killings by Billy the kid seem to be to avenge a friend’s (also employer) death which is described in this book. The book describes how in the wake of John Tunstall’s death, over a debt owed, Billy joined The Regulators and then the Lincoln County war had begun. The fact that this book was so wonderfully documented is the reason we still talk about Billy The Kid. I had fun researching the names mentioned in the book and was able to find photographs of them. This audible version is not of great quality but based on his content perhaps it’s best that way. A great dive into the rustic American wild west and the old gunfighting shootouts, hold on to your hat.

Watkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_R._Watkins) – This book spans the entire length of the Civil War **1861-1865**. In this book the author writes about his experience as a private soldier in the Tennessee first regiment for the confederate army of the south. This is a candid look at the roles of all soldiers, colonels, and generals and the rigid military hierarchy and harsh life especially for a private solider whom are the lowest rank in the army. This is an action packed description of most of the major battles of the civil war such as Shiloh. This book is not for the uneasy stomach as there are vivid descriptions of casualties and cruel punishments for deserters of the confederate army. The writing style is impressive for the time in which it was written and very easy to follow. The author offers strong feelings about the treatment of the private soldier and shares many stories of the human emotional side of the confusing relationship of civilians caught in the cross fire as well as sometimes the casual nature of socializing with the enemy when the fighting was over for the day. It's a mind-boggling story of how anyone could be involved in so many battles and live to tell the tale years later. I like this story of the war more than Grant's book written 3 years later. This version of the war shares more of the shameful dificult decisions made by the confederate generals and this book is shorter with more more compact direct descriptions of the cruelty of battle with fewer obsessions on strategy. This is a page-turner and offers an amazing look at how people lived and talked in the mid 19th century and a close look at the perspective of these young men during a horrible time in history.

The majority of the book is very detailed descriptions of each battle he was involved in during the civil war. He starts by telling a story about getting a raw deal by buying a wild horse and was embarrassed by it. He offers some insight about how and why the war started and the moments that led up to the conflict. Talked about getting hospitality from civilians in the south even though they were enemies. He made many points that if not for bad commands they could have ended the war sooner. He describes interesting thoughts about the press of the time and some of the issues he had with them. The final chapters of the book were very engaging up to the very end and of course he shares his memories of President Lincoln and some of their conversations.

This is a very up close and personal description of the 19th century immigrant families some of which were on the rise with hard work and saving every penny and some struggling to find any daylight. Riis unearths a lifetime lived long before the reader of today, covering the full spectrum of the New York City working classes describing each nationality and their relationships with each other speaking directly without hesitation of the possibility of insulting his audience with what might seem like stereotypes that Riis observed first-hand. There is a chapter of different types of gangs and how they conducted their business in the lower eastside of Manhattan. He tells of the harsh living conditions inside small apartments that are in poor condition neglected by landlords. He speaks of the industry of some of the immigrants and the short coming and exploitation of other groups. Its good that Riis wrote with such clarity as it must have shed light on a situation that would just get worse if nothing was done. People living in rural areas would have had no idea this was going on if not for this book. Riis addresses the hardships of the women and how they were unfairly paid compared to the men. He writes about the youth and how easily they can fall into the wrong hands while parents, if still alive, have no time to watch them. He breaks down the higher cost of rent for black Americans versus what white European immigrants were expected to pay. An amazing look at the goings on of New York City people of a time just after the civil war had ended. Riis also a photographer really describes every square inch and emotions of a time long ago. I could spend a good portion of my day googleing all the awe inspiring pictures that Jacob Riis took of this important subject. For history junkies this is both a gift and it is depressing knowing what some of these people went through and the helplessness they struggled with. Riis really just wanted to make their situation better and help structure city life for the better heading into the 20th century. He inspired better living and tenant rights for the modern working class families of the American cities of the 20th century.

![Hero Tales cover image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/419ZVk4RyqL._SL150_.jpg) (Published 1895) [* Hero Tales](https://www.audible.com/pd/Hero-Tales-Audiobook/B002VACMGW) by [Theodore Roosevelt, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt)[Henry Cabot Lodge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cabot_Lodge) **Narrated by:** Patrick Cullen **Length:** 5 hrs and 40 mins **Rating:** 4.3 **Genre:** History/Combat – This book is about heroic people in American History from the era of the 18th century Revolutionary War period, the 19th century Civil War period, and the battles fought between those two time periods. In the first chapter, there are brief summaries of men such as George Washington, [George Rogers Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Rogers_Clark), and Daniel Boone, as well as pivotal battles of the revolution such as the [Battle of Trenton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Trenton), [The Battles of Saratoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Saratoga), and [Kings Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kings_Mountain) in South Carolina and their importance in securing independence for the Americans. Each section offers quotes from literary scholars of the past such as Lord Byron, greek philosophers, Walt Whitman, and Shakespeare that offer some perspective and meaning of these tales that shaped American culture. It's interesting to hear how these military figures fought hard and persevered to beat back the British and their allies for if they hadn't America would look different than it does today. We wouldn't have a government for the people. In 1895 there wasn't radio or television to tell these stories. Books were the way to keep these heroes alive and I can tell by the romantic effort and the selected tales shared in this volume. Each description is a short 15-minute synopsis of each situation so the details are few and some things are skipped in order to fit everything in an excellent little package however it has assisted me in further researching rabbit holes on Wikipedia. Chapter 2 included stories about the [USS Philadelphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Philadelphia_(1799)) and its capture by barbary pirates in Tripoli a region in northern coastal Africa where the U.S. paid a ransom tax so that the pirates wouldn't attack U.S. ships. They mention [Govenour Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouverneur_Morris) the American representative who bravely stood his post in France during the bloody French revolution despite many other representatives fleeing the scene of carnage. Chapter 4 goes on to tell the stories of the [USS Wasp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Wasp_(LHD-1)), [The Battle of New Orleans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_New_Orleans) led by Andrew Jackson to remove British occupation from the territory, John Quincy Adams's fight for free speech and his pro abolish slavery stance, and Francis Parkman historian who lived with American Indians and wrote the [* Oregon Trail](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Oregon-Trail-Audiobook/B002V8LB2A?eac_link=ARTmFf3d4jcq&ref=web_search_eac_asin_1&eac_selected_type=asin&eac_selected=B002V8LB2A&qid=ihpIzZyODe&eac_id=145-4648773-3645820_ihpIzZyODe&sr=1-1) in 1841. Chapter 4 is about the battle at the Alamo and the civil war with such occurrences as [The Battle of Hampton Roads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hampton_Roads), Stonewall Jackson, and Gettysburg. Chapter 5 describes how the civil war which is suggested as a continuation of the revolutionary war was a marker for the new way to fight in combat with more advanced weaponry especially in naval combat. The final chapter discusses defining battles of the civil war and the heroes that established their names such as [Robert Gould Shaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gould_Shaw) who led the regiment consisting of black Union soldiers, and the wisdom passed on by the young soldier [Charles Russell Lowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Russell_Lowell), the charge at Gettysburg and General Grant at Vicksburg. Other names and battles mentioned in the final chapter are [Philip Sheridan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Sheridan) at Cedar Creek, [William Cushing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_B._Cushing) and the Albemarle, and [David Farragut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Farragut) at Mobile Bay. The book closes with the hero tale of Abraham Lincoln and his famous speech. This is an important book to see how the older generation of the late 19th century held dear to their minds and hearts of that era and the people they saw as heroic and pushing America in the right direction. This was a free listen on audible, and because each story was at most 20 minutes, the book moved quickly. It's fortunate that in this day we have many tools to do a deeper dive into the key figures discussed in this book. I found this book insightful because it goes beyond the big names such as Washington and Lincoln and explains the other important people that shaped America in battle. This book is similar to how W. E. B. Du Bois describes the heroes he held in high regard in his book [The Souls of Black Folk](#bois). This is a link to a digital hard copy of [Hero Tales](https://archive.org/details/cu31924028703415/mode/2up) that has illustrations of each story and I recommend having a gander to further understand this time in American history.

The author paints a picture of the behavior of the wealthy some of which is observational of his own time on earth and partly what he’s learned from his research of the past. Veblen writes his opinions as if he's an alien from another planet observing the human race and their constructs of the hierarchy of wealth and class. C. Wright Mills who references this book and shares his opions about Veblen's theory in The Power Elite led me to read this book. Veblen writes his opinions from more of a scientific perspective of feelings and entitlements whereas C. Wright Mills mentions the actual names and old wealthy families Veblen does not mention any names or families at all. He's writing about wealth and class more like animal behavior when you put a bunch of money here the creature does this. This book was famous for "conspicuous consumption" which I translated to mean showing off your wealth in public without embarrassment. He writes in an old elegant style and I took some pauses to look up the definition of words that aren't commonly used today which was fun. This is not the most exciting book but it's a noble and interesting look at how humans view wealth and what is the expected behavior of the haves and have not’s.

**Length:** 5 hrs and 4 mins **Ratings:** 4.1 – This book spans the era of late **1890's**. This book is about a young woman's life in the American south. The book starts out by painting a picture of a husband and wife and their kids with vivid descriptions of their day-to-day dress and interests. I wanted to find a book with specific thoughts and feelings from people living in the southern part of America in the 19th century. This was helpful to get an idea of what people were thinking about in those days. I like to know what kind of character and values people desired in the late 19th century. Surely this book helped set the tone and inspire The House of Mirth by Edith Wharton. Both of these fictional novels had a similar main character and told a story about a woman’s life at the end of the Victorian era.

Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booker_T._Washington) – This autobiography spans the time of **1856-1900**. Booker T. Washington has a lot of wisdom in his story. He focuses on getting an education to raise himself up, but not just getting the education but the right kind of education and skills that would be desired. He starts his story born into slavery and worked his way up through education. He writes about if you can’t afford something making it with your hands will teach you a valuable lesson. He has stories about teaching Native Americans and then spent most of his life building schools in Tuskegee, Alabama. He has rich stories of his teachers and students. He talks about the people who helped him along the way. Towards the end of the book he talks about a big speech he made in Atlanta and the importance of bringing the north and south together. He had lots of generous support from the north and the south to help build his school. He and his students built the school with their own hands. They laid the brick before they opened their books. Plenty of great details such as becoming great and skilled at something. I was inspired by his clear basic descriptions of how to live life. A natural born leader. He goes into the detail of how nervous he would get before his big speeches. He had great stories of staying with families in the south when he first arrived.

This is a story about De Bois looking for work as a teacher in Tennessee and eventually finding a job as a teacher. He talks about the southern struggle and the difficulty in farm life and making enough money to move up in the world. He has poetic prose in his writing. His chapters are titled which makes the story easy to consume from chapter to chapter and he offers quotes from his inspirations to start each chapter. He talks about black leaders of the past such as Booker T. Washington. He has updates on some of his students and what became of them as they grew up.

This is a fictional story written by a woman author and the main character is a young 20 something woman. I wanted to get the perspective of a woman about how people behaved and what was important to the people of this era. After listening to the opinions and facts of the working class it was a contrast to shift into a story of the wealthy class at the turn of the century and the difficulties fitting into high society and finding a husband or wife to marry. The problems in this culture were petty and not as serious as the struggles of the poor people of the south but still problems to find a way to be apart of something for survival is the struggle described in this story. There are good descriptions of how wealthy people spent their money and how they valued it at the turn of the century.

This book delivers exactly what its title says. The son of Scottish immigrants who arrived in New Orleans in 1822. The author briefly describes how his family and a group of friends decided to leave Scottland to America and eventually settled in St Louis. The bulk of this wild adventurous tale mostly takes place in the era of 1840-1860 ending with a quick wrap up of his later years but what a full life the author paints for us in this great depiction of American history through the eyes of a fur trader making his way through the wild west. His health and thirst for adventure led him to join a group of fur traders that thought of him as a college kid but he quickly learned to dress the part. He gets into the detail about how he was taught the best way to hunt and kill a bear and he relays this to the listener in a way that I realized he's talking to an audience from a long-ago time in which this type of bear killing knowledge would be a great advantage to them and that’s the type of realism that can transport me smack dab into the reality of this book. There are different sets of rules in the life of fur traders living off the land most of which they were either welcomed or snarled at by certain groups of Indians. There are many descriptions of these run-ins each time these trappers found a new place to camp. The hostile Indian tribes he describes as “war parties” who didn't want any peace with the fur traders and he says if the traditional offer to share a smoke was declined they knew they would have to be ready for a fight later. He explains the foolish people who did not heed these warnings were the easy targets for hostile war parties but the fur traders were not to be trifled with as the author writes about their many battles with the Blackfeet Indians. He mentions that the Shoshone Indians were happy to have them when the fur traders entered their territory and they even fought together if their horses were stolen in the night. There is very descriptive language about scalping the enemy and how scalps were used for trade and such. The author describes how handy it was that he learned how to sign (Indian sign language) almost as well as the native Americans and that he was praised for how well he knew this skill. This book is an unbelievable description of a rough life lived and it seems unlikely most could survive this journey. It’s amazing how much has changed since this time. It was a real pleasure to live life with these trappers as they carved out a living during the great migration west in the 1800s.

This story takes place in Chicago and the main characters are Lithuanian immigrants. This tells the story of the industrial explosion and the treatment of the working class. The descriptions of the brutal work and the dangers of working in a meat packing factory are like nothing I've heard before. Upton explains the many ways these immigrants were taken advantage of by swindlers and as we follow our main character Jurgis he grows to understand how he'll need to stand up for his rights. There are great stories about what it was like to spend time in prison in the early 20th century. You will really get a feel of what it would be like if you just arrived in America with high hopes only to learn the many schemes and pitfalls along the way. This is a great description of how the social classes interacted with each other in these early days. There is some unbelievable dialog that will have your jaw on the floor in amazement how casual it was and how relative to our times today. This story is important because its the kind of information that you might have never heard about if Upton Sinclair didn't take the time to write about it. It also may have created better regulations for how American products are manufactured and to help create humane treatment of employees and rights for workers. Most importantly this story is so well written it will put you right into that time as if you traveled back in time.

The theme of this book is the author’s thoughts about the education he received and the education needed for the future to come.  The story digs deep into the education he received from people who taught him their outdated education because that’s what they were taught. He never seems satisfied with learning outdated education because it doesn’t serve him in a rapidly changing world. His prose is very elegant rather than specific and direct. Starting from his birth he breaks each chapter into chunks of years. He is the grandson and great grandson of former presidents of the United States. He did a lot of his education abroad. He pays attention to social behavior and has lots of opinions about differences between Americans and British and Europeans. He references the history of Rome and compares similarities to the happenings of his time in the 19th century. Henry Adams drops so many names in this book it will create a fun task to google all the people he talks about and send you into some lovely rabbit holes. He really gets to the core of how people lived in the 19th century and social games people played especially people involved in politics.

One hundred-plus years ago Jack London wrote a collection of stories about fictional characters' experiences in the Yukon during the Klondike gold rush, not one story running more than 1 hour in length. Jack writes in a natural writing style that is easy to follow and to the point. It's Amazing that he wrote such interesting stories about the hardships and relationships going on in Alaska before he reached 30 years of age. It's easy to see how Jack certainly inspired a new crop of writers such as Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald as they were mere children as Jack was publishing his large collection of works. These stories have grit, humor, suspense, infidelity, and mystery which I'm sure helped inspire the stories we would see on tv and in movies for years to come. I love finding writers that helped inspire writers that I admired from the books I read as a young man. They all learn from those who come before and it's a great discovery for me. I enjoyed the early 20th-century slang and the hard life of scrounging around in the Alaskan wild with harsh conditions to endure. This was a time before we had modern comforts and I find it important to get in touch with lives lived not too long ago. There are 8 stories in this book and they are as follows, Love of Life, A Days Lodging, A Whitemans Way, The Story of Keesh, The Unexpected, Brown Wolf, The Sun Dog Trail, and Negore the Coward. Jack offers the perspective of the Native Alaskans and their feelings about the European settlers that had entered their lands. It's common that when I read stories pre the 20th century that there are heavy Native American influences. This is fascinating to me as most of their preserved way of life is nowhere to be found today especially for those of us who are city dwellers. Just a few smatterings of Native American experiences hast I experienced growing up but they mostly felt like sad recreations and not authentic. You read back 100 years and you can find many of these authentic experiences with Native American culture and there is a lot to learn good and bad. The Native American culture is so abundant in this book I considered adding it to the Native American collection but this book is not from the voice of an actual descendant from a Native American tribe. It's clear Jack London did his research very well and it comes across in these stories. *- 1/05/23*

8.	 ![King Coal cover image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DEQAA-rnL._SL150_.jpg) (Published 1917) [* King Coal](https://www.audible.com/pd/King-Coal-Audiobook/B00MFUZAEE) by [Upton Sinclair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upton_Sinclair) **Narrated by:** Grover Gardner **Length:** 12 hrs and 11 mins **Rating:** 4.8  – This story spans the era of **1913-1914**. Upton tells yet another story about the working people's struggle to earn fare wages and humane working conditions. Just like when Upton took on the meat packing industry and landlords taking advantage of working class immigrants in The Jungle in this book he takes a crack at the coal mining industry. Although a fictional novel Upton draws upon real life stories and does some investigating for added realism to his story about coal mining. This book has a diverse cast of immigrants from Europe and Asia. Upton narrates this as a concerned citizen and breaks down how the coalminers rank themselves and depict a hierarchy of the various nationalities of the coalmining camps. Upton is trying to shed light on the gross mistreatment of the workers who are bossed by cruel heavy-handed threats and the owners of the coalmines whom hardly pay attention to the awful working conditions. What’s most depressing is the danger of the work and to what lengths those in position of power will go to to preserve their profit margins. The narrator goes into deep dives about the threat union organizers plagued the mind of the coal-mining bosses and using political power to make sure the bosses of the mines maintained power. There was a tragic real-life standoff in Colorado in 1913 over striking coal miners and some workers were killed in the standoff which inspired Upton to write this novel. Upton Sinclair uncovers some more ugly truths about advantageous business owners exploiting those desperate for work. I never heard or knew about these sad stories before reading Upton Sinclair's work and I think he's a very important scriber of this harsh era for the working classes and he should be appreciated for that.

The story starts out in Europe and talks about his family and how he interacted with them and what started his interests in inventing gadgets. He writes about his fears, interests and personal achievements he made growing up.  He leads us up to how he eventually makes it to America and the inventions and achievements he made while living in America. This book was very short. He had some interesting details about himself. He tells the story of his experience and his work with Edison. He offers some very insightful feelings about our future and how he feels his inventions can help humanity.

Scott Fitzgerald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Scott_Fitzgerald) **Narrated by:** Robertson Dean **Length:** 9 hrs and 10 mins **Rating:** 4.0 – This novel takes place in the era of **1900-1919**. It follows a young man that is coming of age as he struggles to understand his relationships with women and his status among his peers. The main character feels uncomfortable with the norm and what’s expected he pushes back on authority and the looming doom of WWI. He finds wisdom in his mom's new husband who helps him understand himself and explain the new pressures his generation is facing heading toward the nineteen twenties. I decided to read this book because Frederick Lewis Allen referenced it in Only Yesterday published in 1931. It's a good description of the informal relationships between young men and women than there had been in the high moral expectations of the past. This story had a very familiar feel to the famous Catcher in The Rye and I'd feel foolish if I'd believe that this book didn't directly influence the power of Salinger's masterpiece. This book flows through many characters and scenes but there are some very wonderful chunks in here to teach the reader how things were in America on the cusp of the post war 20's.

In this book Henry Ford talks about the efficiency of mass production just like Ulysses S. Grant talked about war strategies in the civil war. There are many details about his industrial philosophy and how it can shape how we will work for years to come. There are theories of what our purposes in life are. Chapters 16 – 20 were a direct punch of wisdom about human behavior. He shares his philosophies about work and the meaning of life that are applicable today. Henry Ford is open about his racism against Jewish people and he talks about his anti-Semitic publication that he distributed through his businesses.

It focuses on women’s rights and the lack of women’s voices throughout literature predating the 19th century. She puts the importance on the ability to earn enough money to afford the time to write. She writes about her influences and poets who inspired her.

Hemingway’s dialog is direct, repetitive, basic and American. I figure he inspired all the modern American writers since being published. He brings a dirty sense of humor, does a nice job describing a character that is going with the flow, and pointing out things he doesn't like about the war with moments of perfect imagery. It is a work of fiction but also loosely based on Hemingway’s own experiences in the war. It’s been the first book I read in which a famous sports figure was mentioned and I was excited to see that popular sports had officially entered the minds of creative writers such as Hemingway.

If you ever wanted to take a deep dive into the roaring 20's this book does the job. This is wonderfully written with more details and names than I could possibly find time to Google. It describes the big crimes, presidential scandals, popular games, the red scare, the economy boom and then eventual bust. He pinpoints the biggest stories that happened in this era. There was so much I never knew before reading this book and it can really help you learn about the modern culture we enjoy today. There is fascinating minutia such as the rising and lowering of women’s dresses with the trends in fashion and the promiscuity of the youth. There is a chapter of the counter culture led by H.L. Mencken and the bohemians that surely inspired the more famous counter culture of the 40's and 50's led by beatniks such as Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs which are household names today. This is a must read for history junkies there is so much to absorb in this book.

This is like the catcher in the rye for sports. The author is not afraid to burn bridges as he is set to retire and he plans to move on to start writing novels. The early chapters are based on popular athletes that are beloved in the era of the **1920s** to the late **1930s**. There is a great chapter on Babe Ruth and there is a heavy focus on the sport of boxing and the boxing stars of that era.  The later chapters dissects the philosophies, the people running things behind the scenes, unfair treatment of black athletes, the sex appeal marketing strategies, the exploitation of amateur college football players and a variety of feelings and emotions surrounding this wild wacky world we call sports. Never before or will we ever get such a close look into the sports world and peek behind the curtain of all aspects surrounding the sports industry. This book sets the tone for how we deal with our sports hero’s of today. There is a chapter about the difficulties of black athletes of that era and the hypocrisies of the people who controlled sports. He describes women sports in a male chauvinistic manner but also praises some of the best women athletes of that era. And a wonderfuly written indepth description of the beautifulness of the sport of baseball.

Cain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_M._Cain) – This book spans the era of the **1930s** and takes place in Glendale a suburb of Los Angeles County. I was looking for books about Los Angeles and this was one of the included titles available and although a fictional novel I still can get the idea of the surroundings and language of the time. The story tells about a marriage that is ending and the mother of two must find a way to make a living to pay the morgage as she navigates the new challenges that pop up. It's great to hear such raw language and descriptions about realtionships from a time when my grandparents were children and to hear about the visual terrain of an area that I would end up moving to 60 years after this book was published. The character of men and the percieved character of men from that time is interesting to hear about. As so much time goes by its fun to see how many similarities are still prevalent today but of course books such as this is how we can learn and try not to repeat the same mistakes.

The story is an autobiography of Richard Wright. The book mostly depicts life in Mississippi and the south and later it describes Richard's adult life in Chicago. He tells about the difficulties he faced relating to a strict religious family growing up without a father. The stressful unforgiving nature of trying to socialize with white people careful not to say or do the wrong thing. He describes his slow realization that his role in the south was doomed and he day dreams looking for answers and decides he needs to get away from Mississippi and try to make his way north. This is a goldmine of very well written dialog and vivid imagery that can plant the reader right there with him on his journey. Anyone that questions why things are the way they are and wants to discover more out of life than just doing the norm like everybody else can relate to this book. The particular tough life is powerfully and painfully describe in this true story of striving to overcome the odds. He has amazing story of his love for writing stories from his imagination as a boy and then he tells about how he escaped through books as he grew older and uncovered a whole new world of people who were curious about the world around just like he was and he lists his favorite books from that time. Richard has unabashing story of the communist parties and radicals that were current in the late 1920's and early 30's in Chicago.

The story is an autobiography of Betty MacDonald. The book starts out describing her early life growing up in Montana, but the majority of the story tells about her time living on a farm in the mountains on the Olympic Peninsula near Seattle, Washington. This was the first audio book that I had to slow down the speed of the audio to keep up with all the descriptive swirling sentences and imagery. There are some very amazing descriptions of town life and even the smells of the shops in this rural town and also the informative depictions of the towns people delivered with effortless humor. It was towards the end of the book that I realized how much it reminded me of Cannery Row by John Steinbeck and as it turns out both of these books were published in the same year in 1945. I wondered who had influenced whom but it seems that both authors were just feeling this moment in time in the pacific north west.

Wright Mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Wright_Mills) **Narrated by:** Sean Runnette **Length:** 15 hrs and 54 mins **Ratings**: 4.6 **Genre**: Sociology – This story spans the era of **1865-1955**. This book is trying to define a group of individuals that make up the American power elite and how these people become powerful and make big decisions that have massive affects on everybody who lives in America and around the world. This book starts out a little slow taking its time to describe who are the power elite and what is the power elite. Then the author writes about the difference between new wealth compared to old wealth of these times. I had to pause often to google all the wealthy powerful people he mentions. Mills has a philosophy of how the wealthy became wealthy. He describes many stats of the wealthy that is hard to keep up with for example the amount of millionaires in 1865 vs the amount of millionaires in 1890 and the percentage of wealthy people who graduated from college in 1890 compared to the wealthy in 1950. A deep dive on how many wealthy came from modest working class families in 1865 vs the amount in 1950. He talks of the difficulties to get anywhere near the amount of the wealth of the power elite by just saving up a yearly salary. This book takes a very interesting look at how America's economy functions and the relationship between social classes. The author mentions and quotes all the attempts to explain wealth in America before he took a crack at it in 1956. There is an enlighting chapter about how the power elite can obviously use the media to push along agendas that will benefit the wealthy. There is much to learn by reading this but you have to pay close attention as the author uses an elegant writing style with lots of big words.

I like this book because it deals with a man who has failed at his acting career which has stunted his growth toward building a stable career. It's a very relatable American story for those who dream big but miss and now have trouble dealing with the reality of their life. The father of the main character resembles the stable figure who worked hard and became a respected doctor. The father uses his philosophy to live a simpler life with attainable goals to mock his son and his childish habits. The son is begging to be understood but the father seems to want to be left alone so he can enjoy the few years he has left, and would prefer not to be interrupted by his son’s self-inflicted problems. This was only the second book I chose to read from the fascinating decade of the 1950s and I think it's interesting because it felt like a modern story about a millennial, it's nice to know people weren't so practical from an era that seemed so clean-cut and structured. It is nice to see there were also chaotic lives being led by people with a strong father figure to look up to. This story is very well written and I think an important cautionary tale of living a free American life and where life might take you. It has the same tone as F. Scott Fitzgerald and JD Salinger about human relationships, sad truth, and comedy. *- 2/12/22*

Part 1 of this book titled *This Is My Story* was published in **1938**, the memoir takes place in the era of **1880s - 1920s**. This book follows Eleanor's grandparents and her mother's upbringing in New York City. The former first lady tells us about her father's family and her father’s famous brother, former President Teddy Roosevelt. This is a jaw-dropping first-hand experience of living life in the late 19th century and year-to-year recapitulations of raising a young family in the early 1900s. If you ever wondered how people lived, talked, dressed, and how they entertained themselves this book is a wonderful retelling of that transitional time from the old Victorian period to the beginning of the roaring 20s. Eleanor comes across as a very thoughtful human who is very candid about her shortcomings and her big heart and empathy for those in need especially those traumatized by WWI. She tells us about her work at the hospital as a red cross volunteer. The bulk of her story is about her involvement in politics and women's suffrage. She seems to be a natural at diplomacy and has an eye for detail such as how her mother-in-law forced her agendas regarding FDR’s medical problems to explain minute details of Franklin D's best friend and assistant [Louis Howe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Howe). Eleanor gives us her painstaking tales of raising 6 children with the help of many caretakers and getting through the flu pandemic of that early period and of course the infantile paralysis which affected her husband, former President Franklin D Roosevelt. One thing that I immediately wondered was that she married someone with the same last name which she does address in the book and said that she married her 5th cousin, which seemed to be common in those times. As a side note, it was really cool to hear about living her life in 1904 around the time [*The House of Mirth*](#mirth) was published. She mentions several names such as Schmedley Butler who she met during the war and Henry Adams as the wise old man departing wisdom to Franklin early in his political career. The fascinating part of Schemdley Butler is that he would eventually publish a book (currently on my audible wish list) about war profiteering called *War Is a Racket* published in 1935 which led me to watch some of his speeches on youtube from the **1930s**. I have already read [Henry Adams' memoir](#adams) painting us a picture of life inside a famous American political family 100 years prior to this. She also mentions [Bernard Baruch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Baruch) as a financial advisor to FDR and I found Bernard also has a memoir on audible published in the **1950s** which I look forward to reading. Reading Henry's book and then this book back to back would give you a pretty good description of high society political American families' day-to-day first-hand descriptions of the past 200 years prior to 1960.

Part 2 is titled *This I Remember* published in **1949**. Part 2 is a detailed description of the government's role (led by President Franklin D Roosevelt) in pulling America out of the Great Depression of the **1930s** and the transition into the clashes that led to WWII in the **1940s**. Eleanor shares candid stories of the [New Deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal) and how it helped Americans retain purpose in a time of economic destitution. She gives us a minute-by-minute retelling of where she and the president were when the Japanese military attacked Pearl Harbor and the events that followed. Eleanor provides her acts of diplomacy meeting with the top leaders of the world and their many royal visitors that would come stay with them at the white house. I am sure some things were transcribed vaguely in the vein of national security but this is an amazing way to live virtual or vicariously in the explosive and complex time of the late 1930s and early 1940s. I was not aware that Buckingham Palace had been bombed until reading it in this memoir and had the pleasure to google the pictures as I followed along. The book gives us the passing of important figures of this time including FDR's most trusted consultant and diplomat Mr. Howe. Eleanor had quite a story to tell while her husband served 3 terms which I wondered as to how since the current rule is no more than 2 terms are allowed for Presidents of the united states. Eleanor shows us her strength to get out in front and be very much in the public eye dealing with lies in the press and the possibility of violence. This memoir closes with the eventual illness of her husband that caused his death and the breaking up of their large family home Val-Kill. There is a book called [*The Great Depression*](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Great-Depression-Audiobook/B0030E4PYU?ref=a_library_w_c5_lProduct_31&pf_rd_p=95b555b2-2931-4812-98e1-6535e764d43f&pf_rd_r=K5AWTY0QJ2ZZH41MCE5Q) in my audible wish list that is a diary of a man living in 1930s depression-era that would be great to follow up on. I feel getting the point of view of the great depression from a common person would provide a nice contrast to the experiences of the elite ruling class. For more actual reference of this time in [Russell Baker's autobiography](#baker), he reads actual handwritten letters that were addressed to his mother by a danish immigrant baker and he describes month-by-month updates of his trying times in 1930s America. I feel that the recounting of the depression from Baker’s book provides a vivid context of the struggle of that era.

Part 3 is titled *On My Own* published in **1958**. It is hard to imagine Eleanor was in her 70s  with the amount of traveling around the globe she partakes in. She discusses her continued involvement with the United States government as the representative for America in the United Nations and the candidates she supported. She participated as a diplomat and explored many regions overseas such as Bali, Morocco, Hong Kong, Beirut, Germany, and Moscow. Eleanor, a champion for human rights, explains the common people of these faraway regions and the many facets of their culture. She has a particularly fascinating insight into Russia and the Russian leaders and representatives of that time. She even goes as far as to declare a warning not to lose touch with Russia and continue diplomacy with them. "What I feared is that we would not understand the nature of the Russian revolution that is still going on and what it means to the world. If we fail to understand then we shall fail to protect world democracy no matter what missiles or earth satellites or atomic warships we produce.". She explains this in depth in chapter 38 when she was hired by the New York Post to write a series of articles about the Soviet Union. She met with Nikita Khrushchev when she visited Moscow and she exemplified her specialties as a negotiator and conflict mediator. She claims she made all these travels as a newspaper person, and her bravery and compassion bleed from her well-written and direct style of writing. Hard to imagine a person as important and involved with structuring the 20th century in America doesn’t get talked about as much as I would think as I was born just 100 years after she was. This 3 part series is an important document of American history.

Dick writes about his early life growing up in St. Louis and his athletic achievements on his high school track team. He writes about how he developed his humor to hide insecurities and to enhance his social status among his peers. He explains how he used his charm several times throughout his life to make his life better and push his dreams forward to land his goals. Dick Gregory has many details of how he used his persuasion to not just help his life but to also help those in need of some wisdom to turn their lives around. He writes about his activism, support and speeches made during the civil rights marches in Mississippi. His opinions of race relations and class differences are very insightful. He has an intelligent philosophical idea of white and black people delivered with a touch of humor to tie it all together. He shared some comedy 101 about when some jokes will work and when they won't. I love this book because I feel like Dick Gregory's story and his comedy was missed by the millennial generation and he is not often mentioned by other comedians as a pioneer, which he most definitely is. If you are trying to come to grips with how people with differences can ever get along in this world pick up this book and travel back to the 40's 50's and 60's and see how those who came before us struggled with it.

Off the top of my head, I have already read 2 other biographies that take place in the same region by authors born in the same era as Lenny Bruce, and they are Russell Baker's [Growing Up](#grow), Robert Evans’s [The Kid Stays in The Picture](#kid-re), and Richard Feyman’s [Surely You're Joking](#joke). Baker is a famous journalist, Evans is a famous paramount pictures head of production, and Feynman is a famous physicist, Lenny gives us his perspective as a stage performer/comedian/social commentator. The narrator of this book speaks in a sly tone with a New York City accent trying to mimic Lenny's hip persona. Even though Lenny is of my granddad's generation I have heard his name mentioned continuously throughout my life, mostly by other comedians that thank him for his groundbreaking style of comedy. The controversy behind Lenny is that he didn't sugarcoat his language, he spoke how people would speak freely on the street to their friends, and at the time he did this, it was not well received by the mainstream. You can see by looking at a picture of Lenny that he is not a threat at all and it's ridiculous that he was put through so much by taking a chance doing comedy his way. Lenny starts his story by talking about his mother and father who were divorced. Bruce says as a child in the 30s in NYC he picked up on dirty jokes he would hear adults say to each other. As a teenager, Bruce remembers working on a farm for a Dutch couple that he grew very close to and getting his feelings hurt when he realized he was just a farmhand to them when he wanted to be looked upon as a close relative. Bruce describes the sadness of being in WWII in the 1940s but covers it with his humorous perspective. Then he leads us into how he broke into performing on stage getting his first breakthrough with his mother's help and getting a laugh causing him to get hooked. Bruce doesn't tell his story in the most conventional tone but he seems to lay out his story in a poetic fashion inspired by the jazz of the time. He talks about his time impersonating a priest in Florida which sounded so ridiculous it seemed like he was writing about a dream. Lenny describes his move to Los Angeles and working in Hollywood as a writer and performing standup at strip clubs. He goes into the marriage struggles with his wife Honey and how he failed to make it work. The final half of the book is basically him reading court transcripts for being arraigned for saying the phrase “cock-sucker” on stage in San Francisco. It seems like the people in charge of these cities didn’t appreciate Lenny Bruce’s tongue and wanted to make him sorry for it. Lenny’s health was failing from his use of drugs which comes across in the scattered notes toward the end. I’m glad these memoirs from these people from my grandparent's generation exist. I get to see what their culture was like and how the people around them behaved. Certainly sheds light on how culture in America has gotten to where it is now.

I was craving non-fiction stories from southern California and this book fits the bill perfectly. There is some true crime, some insightful opinions of the type of Americans that want to come to California and the types of social bubbles they want to project once they arrive. Didion uses endearing descriptions to show the contrast of a young musician’s fame versus old Hollywood fame. When the southern California let downs and depression washes over you she describes the banal indifference so well. She takes us on a deep dive into the San Francisco hippy movement, which she describes as a chaotic time of disorder. She describes the 60's in a way that I never thought about before, she really helps you understand how loose and scary it all seemed for those people that prefer things to be under control and prefer people that can be dependable. Didion brilliantly explains how she needed to be ok with disorder and to realize most of these kids were not being taught the rules of society. This is my first time reading any Joan Didion and I am excited to read more of her work. I don't find a lot of non-fiction describing California since I started my American history research and this book is an absolute gem and Joan Didion has become one of my favorite authors.

It is theorized, that changes to how humans live are speeding up faster than ever before and causing in some people traumatic stress. The book starts by showing the reader how humans lived practically the same for a large percentage of human history up to this monumental era of 1970 where a shift has happened compared to the time when humans started agriculture and the massive change that created back then. The author uses many excerpts from other writers about their observations of how quickly changes are happening compared to the past. He stresses the importance of being aware of this special time we are living in and not to just ignore it like some people particularly older generations tend to do while the youth embrace the change. He stated some insightful commentary on the multiple amounts of sub cults creating more chaos to a rapidly changing world. As for sub cults he describes a brief history of the hippies and what they evolved into. There is a chapter of how education will need to evolve to meet this ever-changing world, he writes a rather insightful observation about how we focus too much on the past but aren't taught how to envision the future. Thus he encourages reading more Sci-Fi books such as 2001 by Arthur C. Clarke. Future shock takes a thoughtful look at controlling our technology to keep it from spinning us out of control and over stimulating us. He proposes therapeutic suggestions for example perhaps for those of us who have trouble with all the technology advancements should look for communities purposely setup to recreate old styles of living such as the Amish communities live. This book was written in 1970 so reading it in 2021 was pretty interesting. I'd like to read more from this author and learn about how he viewed his predictions after living through them.

The main character Harry is a writer living in a dilapidated apartment complex that is under renovation but Harry is holding out refusing to move so he can focus on his routine finishing his novel. Eventually, he discovers he has a neighbor diligently typing away on his novel as well, a black man named Willie Spearmint. They confront each other's racial and cultural differences throughout the story. This story specifically focusses on the discourse between black and Jewish cultures airing out stereotypical differences while bonding over the art and discipline of writing a novel and discovering an original voice. I found this book by reading [World of our Fathers](#fathers) which referenced notable Jewish American writers, Malamud was one of the main voices of this era. Malamud's most famous novel was The Natural which became a classic baseball movie starring Robert Redford. The Tenants was also adapted into a movie in 2006 starring Snoop Dog. Melamud writes the perspective through Harry, inspired by the tense relationship between the landlord and tenants of that time. The book takes a bit of a bipolar tone whether or not it was intended but perhaps mainly because Malamud is writing the voice of both characters the main in which he can personally relate to and the other he has to speculate a voice he thinks is closest to the truth of black cultural and the feelings towards Jewish people. *- 2/22/22*

This book takes place in the era of **1945-1975** and tells a story about growing up as a child of Chinese immigrants in Stockton, California. I wanted to read a non-fictional story from an Asian American writer and this is a very interesting book with some effortless humor sprinkled in at times through Maxine’s honesty of her surroundings and the people she grew up with. It's a very candid story of her relationships growing up with her peers and her family’s personal struggles along with her confrontations with her parent’s expectations, particularly butting heads with her mom. I like this American story of how people adjust when leaving behind an old culture but still remembering fondly the stories that were told to them when they were young. Most of the story takes place in Stockton, California, some of this book talks about LA and the story talks about the family history from China. The sacrifices made to make a new life in America and still trying to hold on to the Chinese customs but the breaking away of the author to be herself is authored beautifully in this book. When learning about American history first hand it's important for me to hear all the voices that make up America and what their experiences were versus my own.

This book informs us early on of the hardships and social pressures aimed toward the Jewish people of Russia that created a desire to find new land to seek freedom from persecution and to find wealth, opportunity, and fair wages for their labors and skills. The author takes his time to describe the history of the Jewish people their various languages such as Yiddish and Hebrew their religious values and a vision of their environment in Russia in the mid 19th century. Howe describes leaving the small shtetls and entering larger European cities in Germany before embarking on the rough ride on filthy ships to Ellis Island. Most of the story takes place in New York City and the nerve-racking experiences dealing with rigorous inspections once arriving at Ellis Island. There are amazing details of all the difficulties of navigating through hustlers and passing examinations after arriving in America. Howe makes sure to set up the imagery of the problem and then describes the Jewish Americans that created organizations to help the newcomers to have an easier time and avoid being sent back to where they came from. Howe also describes the many differences and feelings of the more established German jews of this time versus the eastern European new arrivals with not much money to even get started in America. He reminds the reader of the scarcity of good-paying jobs and how hard it was for these immigrants referred to as green-horns to get ahead in their new world. This is a good book to get a history of how all immigrants who migrated here at this time and exactly what they went through as Howe shares excerpts from actual people living at this time. This is a must-read if you'd like to know how some families got started in America and how different it is today. Howe mentions so many figures of this time, writers, millionaires, politicians, and Jewish radicals that I had to pause to research them as I listen. There is a lengthy chapter on Jewish radicalism and worker unions set up to fight back for the poor immigrants that were being mistreated and taken advantage of. Religious values played a big part in the Jewish people’s struggle to work hard and save up to be able to move away from the overcrowded tenement houses in Lower east-side NY. There are a few chapters on the political statistics and voting trends of the Jewish community and how candidates able to speak fluent Yiddish helped secure the Jewish vote. There are rags to riches stories of individuals that pioneered the movie industry out west such as The Warner Bros. The most-mentioned name in this book is Abraham Kahan, the voice for the Jewish working class. There is a lengthy portion of this book that discusses Yiddish literature, Yiddish poets and novel writers, and a backstory of their lives. There is a brief history of the Yiddish theater and actors at the turn of the century and then the story blends into modern Jewish voices of the latter half of the century. The author quotes Lenny Bruce and references Philip Roth and how the Jewish culture is represented in modern times. There is a chapter about famous Jewish artists that studied in France and brought their skills to contribute to American modern art. The book wraps up on a description Jewish suburban lifestyle as Jewish families that moved away from the cities and old tenements and the old Yiddish culture starts to disappear and Jewish traditions become less important to younger generations. This book had me open up several google tabs to search all the names that represented the eastern European culture that had strived to escape their role as manual laborers and eventually achieve the same success of their  allies, the German Jews. I started my American history research by reading an account of the pilgrims arriving in New England in the early 1600s and now I have an even clearer description of eastern European Jews arriving here in the 1800s by an author who lived in this era.

**Length:** 8 hrs and 27 mins **Rating:** 4.9 – This book is a firsthand journalistic account of day-to-day life during a tumultuous time of the Vietnam war and it takes place in the era of **1967-1969**. Herr captures the cruel visuals, feelings, and language of the American soldiers depicted with unflinching dialog. The language is particularly rough adding a type of realism that can put you into their boots. Scary helicopter rides, close calls, the constant bad feelings are how Herr manages his way through this unpleasant time in history. He describes the personalities of soldiers (Marines) and their commanding officers. Aside from all the exterior horrible things I grew up hearing about this war, this book takes you inside the mind of the people facing the action and how the fear drove some of these men crazy. The dialog of the soldiers in this book is so real it’s no wonder that Herr's remembrance of these conversations would eventually be used in such memorable classics about Vietnam such as Apocolypse Now and Full Metal Jacket. The feelings of the differences soldiers had toward the correspondents of the war describe the dynamic between the two and it creates a great narrative. The story tells how the correspondents were there to write about the war and photograph it but also they were in just as much danger as the soldiers were. There are graphic details of various war stories and rescue missions. A large part of the book does a deep look into the American strategy at Casaun and the bad vibe of that particular location. Herr mentions many references to the music of the time such as the Doors and Jimi Hendrix and draws a comparison of how art pop-culture style and the styles of the soldiers started to become one thing. He mentions many of his fellow correspondents that I had the fun task of researching them to see the photos that they captured during the Vietnam war. Herr writes about wrestling with his feelings of the soldiers that were killed that he got to know just moments before they'd be getting put into a body bag and how hard it was for him to shake the memories of them. Herr describes the sleepless nights and battles of PTSD that would not leave him alone. He admits as a journalist he wasn’t supposed to get so involved with feelings but that it was very tough for him to handle his emotions towards the dead, lost, and injured casualties of this war. During my American history first-hand research I've considered books about American wars such as Farwell to Arms describes WWI crucial to understand the government’s reasons to have these wars and the thoughts of the young Americans sent to fight them. How the people of this time feel about this war is an important part of the American story.

This story is the first in a series of related novels narrated by the main character Nathan Zuckerman. It describes the experience of a young up incoming writer working with an older established writer in the writer’s home and noticing the life and the emotions of the people around him. The book describes the pressure to write the truth while the main character’s family and friends hold his written words against him. Roth describes guilt instilled in a young writer that hears an earful for having the balls to write about his feelings about Jewish people and culture. The narrator is conflicted about why he should not be allowed to write about such taboo topics even though he is a Jewish man himself. I read this book because Roth was referenced in [World of our Fathers](#fathers). I have not read many books by Jewish American authors and I think that understanding the Jewish experience in America is a necessity to understand American history through first-hand experience.

**Length:** 12 hrs and 24 mins **Rating:** 4.8 – This book is a deep dive into the various groups of ethnicities that have migrated to North America through a span of time from **17th century to the 20th century**. Each chapter focuses on a group of people who migrated from a specific landmass from all the main continents of the world Europe: (Ireland, Germany (Amish, Jews)), Italy, Russia (Jews), Asia: (China, Japan), Africa and South America: (West Indies, Peurto Rico, Mexico). Sowell takes a thoughtful look at the reasons each ethnic group decided to make the treacherous journey across the ocean to settle in an unfamiliar land, he explains the conditions of the journey, the pitfalls and treatment upon arrival from which these new settlers struggled to overcome. Sowell writes about the hardships of working their way up and the difficulties of receiving fair treatment such as proper education, better-paying jobs, and getting representatives into politics. He articulates what each ethnic group specializes in, and what inherited characteristics helped them in these fields. Sowell obviously did his research and uses statistics to show unemployment, job types, percentages of single-parent families, average salaries not just by ethnicity but considering location, ethnic temperments, inventions, and contributions to things folded into American values that we all know and love today. For example beer, hotdogs and hamburgers are considered a very American staple of our food and beverage standards but it all came from the German immigrants which had settled in the Pennsylvania region and much of what is now considered middle America. One mainline Sowell keeps reminding the reader when explaining upward mobility of each ethnic group is the trend of an upper-class representative who has achieved great wealth tends to have had fewer children or no children at all  which ends the ability to pass on the skills which had helped them gain their wealth. For when this is so it resets accomplishments made toward the ethnic group and the skills are lost instead of being passed on through bloodlines. As Sowell points out on the contrary that poorer families tend to have many children and do not have skills of how to attain wealth to pass on. I’m not sure why Sowell focused on this point but it might be to give some answers to the question of why some members of a particular family may be stuck with earning lower class wages if never taught how to earn better wages for ones self. Sowell describes the subtle differences between sub groups within each ethnic group by the region from where they had come from, such as the compariable differences of Irish to the scotch-Irish, Italians from north Italy to Italians from southern Italy, blacks from the West Indies to the blacks who had been in America for hundreds of years. Sowell describes the issues these regional differences caused. He also points out that if a group of people from the same region had become acquainted in America, they dealt with people who just were just arriving with perhaps in a bit of a prickly manner. This book is going to open your mind way up to what makes up America and how long all these different cultures from far away places have been converging. It’s nice to hear the stories of triumph toward achieving their dreams. Sowell ends each chapter by listing out the names of notable people from each ethnicity which is helpful for me to find more books about American people of the past. It’s always fun to read the wikipedia page of these notable people and go into some fun rabbit holes. I think this is an important lesson to understand through generations removed how America started to populate the 50 states. Although Sowell did not experience this first-hand he references many writings from that time. [How The Other Half Lives by Jacob Riis](#riis) is a first-hand experience much about what Sowell writes if you’d like to take a closer look. I found this book when I saw a parody account on Twitter posting Thomas Sowell quotes and I decided to see if his books were available on audible. As it turns out he has many books “Included” in the audible library including this one. *- 3/08/22*

**Length:** 8 hrs and 55 mins **Rating:** 4.8 – This book is a deep dive about the history of the progression of black women's voices, literature and the feminism movement through a span of time from **mid 19th century to late 20th century**. hooks points out that black women didn't just carry the burden of racism targetted against them but also the opression of sexism as well. hooks feels that when most people fight for the civil rights of black people they really mean for black men while black women's issues remain in the background and not seen as important. hooks argues that women rights are focused on white women's rights and that the feminist movement doesn't deal with black women's rights directly as a separate issue. She cleverly argues that it's completely overlooked that black women are fighting two issues, dealing with the negativety from whites towards black people but also sexism within the black communuity delivered toward them by shauvenistic black men. I think this is a book about fairness and to bring awarness to a group of women who's issues deserve a closer look and empathy. hooks mentions a bunch of names of progressive black women who spoke out and wrote books about black women's rights long ago such Anna Julia Cooper and Souljouner Truth. I had fun time learning about these brave women and have added their books to my reserch about the fabric of American society. *- 3/23/22*

32.	![Growing Up cover image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51QzbL+0o7L._SL150_.jpg) (Published 1982) [Growing Up](https://www.audible.com/pd/Growing-Up-Audiobook/B076ZQSY6X) by [Russell Baker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Baker) **Narrated by:** Corey M. Snow **Length:** 8 hrs and 19 mins **Rating:** 4.5 – This is a memoir of the early years of Russell Bakers' life during the depression era of the **1930s** and into the WWII era of the **1940s**. Russell's focus in the first third of this book is on his mother, father, and his grandmother. The story starts out in rural Virginia and eventually his family's life in northern New Jersey. Russell is telling a story based on the strength of the women in his life that helped to raise him. He goes into brief backstories of his grandparents and great-parents and their 19th-century background. The theme is that it is important to his mother that he make something of himself and there are many other wise sayings from his mother. I wonder if this book helped to carry these sayings over to my generation. Baker is from my grandfather's generation, it helped me visualize the world my grandfather grew up in. I was surprised to see similarities in toys and popular fictional characters of Baker's childhood to my childhood experiences. Describing his grandmother's buttoned-up Victorian attire is a fascinating first-hand detail of the culture of the 19th century. In-depth details of the daily chores of his mother and grandmother during the depression era of the 1930s. He describes the natural beauty of his hometown and the many family members and neighbors of the community. Russell writes with such descriptive details he sets the image of his mom's brothers and each of their unique styles, hygiene, and political views with the backdrop of the depression. I was surprised to learn the comforts such as indoor plumbing that we take for granted in modern times were not available to all families of the 1930s. Baker shares actual letters written to and from his mother which helps bring the reader into the mind of someone trying to find work and love in the middle of the great depression. Baker closes the final part of this book by telling us how he excelled at writing, furthering his education, enlisting in the military, and eventually meeting his future wife. Most importantly Baker tells us so much about how people landed in his life, what he observed of them and what he was able to learn from them even if the lesson was what not to do. I think this book is written in a fearless and humorous tone that perhaps the writers of today might not be willing to.

Levy tells a history of a group of the earliest computer programmers, hardware hackers and video game developers. In Part 1 Levy describes the curious math and computer students that couldn't wait to get their hands on the massive million-dollar computer that ran on punch cards for instructions. Eventually, these students were granted access and they each took turns writing programs and challenged each other to write the same program using fewer lines of code. The first generation programmers (hackers) believed in keeping software open, transparent, and free for other programmers to use, tinker, and refine. They called it the “hacker ethic”. It is helpful to follow along with the [Hackers Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution), each chapter is summarized with links to the many people involved in creating the “hacker ethic”.  Part two of the book is about hardware hackers and the microcomputer movement of the **1970s** with the idea that every person could have a computer in their home. Part 3 is about the computer video game development explosion in the 1980s. This book marks the beginning of independent hackers writing computer programs and coding languages. It's surprising that even way back then the book discusses the interests of these individuals which included Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. It's fascinating to hear about how these hackers created the first well-known video game and how they wrote programs for a robotic arm. Levy laysout the naive joy of the hackers by sharing computer programs in the early days and wrestling with the amazing power of the computers enriching their lives with disregard of the amount of wealth it could bring to programmers. With the success of Steve Wozniak computer programming started to become the next gold rush. This book spends the entire final 3rd of the story talking about video game developer Ken Williams and his wife Roberta Williams and their star game programmer John Harris at Sierra Online. It’s amazing all this interesting stuff happened in computer technology 10 years before the internet took over. As a developer myself I have learned how to make web apps which are programs written for web browsers. This book is a smooth read to listen to with a ton of fun factoids about how the hackers solved the problems of their time. I think exploring how computer programming got started in America is an important thing to learn about how the move to programming computer technology helped shape American society and its effect on the American culture. *- 5/13/22*

The bulk of the argument is about the immense power that television has over the world, specifically how it directly creates a culture in America. Postman sets out to point out the decline of typography and it being replaced by television and the effect it has on our public discourse. I found this book from a tweet by somebody I follow and it was perfect timing because I was looking for non-fiction in the 1980s and it is included in the audible membership. It reminded me of the book Futureshock in where both books describe the speeding up of industry and information and the consequences this might have on society. Postman does a good job setting up his theory by comparing Orwell's and Huxley's prophecies of the future of society and deciding which prophecy most describes present-day 1985. Postman writes he wouldn't mind the comparison to Marshall McLuhan's famous phrase "the medium is the message" as he continues to describe what a medium is and what's its purpose is and concludes his own phrase, “the medium is the metaphor”. He has many arguments about how television is image-based and it disrupts our public discourse once enjoyed by people of the past. He writes about how the invention of the telegraph has allowed decontextualized information to travel over vast spaces at incredible speed. There is an amazing chapter about the American history of typography starting from 1600's New England up to the transition of the telegraph and eventually print media with advertisements. How America went from hardly having any books printed here in the early 17th-century Postman describes the first newspapers and early American authors which had me researching pioneers such as Thomas Paine and finding so many more books to add to my American history research. Postman shows off his intelligence in this book using big philosophical words and theories. This is probably a book I'll need to listen to again to fully grasp all the information and things to pay attention to in the culture around me today. Postman is definitely trying to warn people to think about what they know and see and realize the source from which it comes from and the creators of such content may not have your best interest. I think this is an awesome book to read for the education of American culture. Much of the content I was raised on came from American television which is also watched around the world. The funny thing is that I grew up with a healthy dose of people telling me “tv will rot your brain” and that I should pick up a book and read instead which I agree is good advice but I also notice when typography was the main medium of its time the parents of that time had the same skeptical feelings about books as the parents of today have of tv. Postman makes an interesting point about political debates in a 19th-century culture people were prepared to sit through 7-hour debates versus present-day a politician who uses images and must look good on television. He sites people of the past had the capacity to sit and listen and understand complex sentences from a speech but in today’s culture, we could hardly be expected to have that much patience.

Feynman that spans the era of **1920-1976**. This is a collection of stories recorded by friends and lectures given in front of a live audience. Feynman explains his early beginnings as a bright experimental child growing up in Queens, New York fixing radios and working for his aunt's hotel business. He describes his college life while attending MIT which lead him to Princeton. As an undergrad, he has a monumental shift in his life giving a lecture as a professor’s assistant attended by the biggest minds of the science world such as Albert Einstein. Feynman writes in a relatable tone with humor and brings you into his fascinating life. Feynman without coming off as braggadocious describes himself as a man with many interests. He is really a jack of all trades, describing extracurricular activities such as safe cracking, joining a salsa group as a professor of theoretical physics in Brazil, he became a regular barfly in Buffalo, a prolific sketch artist, and a touring bongo player. Feynman explains the math behind his thinking and scientific experiments throughout the book. In the chapter “Lucky Numbers”, he tells a story about how he challenged a man skilled in the use of an abacus to see who could solve math equations first with Richard using only his brain. Even though he goes deep into mathematical arithmetics in this book it’s hard to understand unless you are well-educated in math but it doesn’t derail the flow of his story. In other words, you don’t have to be a math major / physicist to follow along. In the chapter titled “Los Alamos from below”, adapted from a lecture given at the University of California in Santa Barbara in 1975, Feynman describes his time in Los Alamos and his contribution to the development and testing of the atomic bomb. This is the longest chapter in the story spanning over 1 hour and it might be the most interesting part of this book as far as I am concerned. The names and events mentioned in this fascinating chapter as he worked closely with people like Oppenheimer. Feynman writes about how he was a good bull-shit detector. In the chapter titled Is Electricity Fire? He describes his time as a representative of science on the committee “Ethics of equality” in New York. He described the other attendees as “pompous fools” and said the subject of ethics was undefined. He said people were using word salads to avoid defining anything in plain English. In the chapter titled “Cargo Cult Science”, he prophesizes a degradation of science and experiments. Implying scientists are willing to risk their scientific integrity to cut corners and arrive at desired results. The stories curated for this book were well chosen and flow nicely together. The book is broken up into 5 main chunks, the titles are as follows “Part 1: FROM FAR ROCKAWAY TO MIT”, “Part 2: THE PRINCETON YEARS”, “Part 3: FEYNMAN, THE BOMB, AND THE MILITARY”, “Part 4: FROM CORNELL TO CALTECH, WITH A TOUCH OF BRAZIL”, and “Part 5: THE WORLD OF ONE PHYCISIST”. This is an important book for understanding American history to help with the understanding of how science, physics, and the academic side pushed America ahead for better or worse.

The story starts by talking about [Ross Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Ross_Johnson) who is the President of Nabisco in the era of the **1980s**. The journalists wrote about uncovering all the behind-the-scenes negotiations of a [Leveraged buyout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leveraged_buyout), junk bonds (high-risk investments), jockeying for advantageous positions within the deal, back-stabbing, and corporate greed. They lay out the story by giving us a brief history of how The National Biscuit Corporation was started by [Adolphus Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolphus_W._Green) in 1898 and Nabisco’s humble beginnings and the invention of the world's most famous cookie the Oreo. Then they tell us about the origins of R.J. Reynolds tobacco company started by [R.J. Reynolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._J._Reynolds) and the company’s early beginnings in Winston-Salem, NC in the late 19th century. They mention the rise of the tobacco company which became the most successful tobacco company of its time and the great things it did for its employees providing them with class-A stock. We are told when Ross Johnson helped Nabisco and RJR merge in 1985, it was the biggest merger of its time. They write about the reckless ways money was splashed around by young careless tycoons who didn't care about the history of these companies and lived high on the hog in what would eventually come to destroy the integrity of this company. For example, Ross Johnson liked to make friendships with former professional athletes such as Reggie Jackson and Jack Nicklaus and put them on the Nabisco payroll with high salaries to have them do meet-n-greets. They paid the Golden Bear a 1 million a year salary and he was sometimes obliged to golf with Nabisco business associates. It is crazy to me that you could get a salary that large for doing a few appearances every once in a while and I find it frustrating that people can barely find work that pays them more than 50k a year today. They go into the history of the equity firms that practice LBOs and the men behind them such as Henry Kravis, Peter Cohen and Ted Fortsman. The leveraged buyout is when a large investment firm with lots of money offer to buy a mammoth company such as Nabisco. It's an unbelievable story that sounds like Ross Johnson who lucked his way into running a company he had nothing to do with founding and yet he stood to make a personal profit by allowing Nabisco to be bought. I'm not giving anything away here, the story starts out by telling us Johnson blindsided his board by informing them he is going to put RJR Nabisco up for a LBO and there's not much they can do to change his mind. Then the journalist rewinds the story to explain the circumstances leading up to how the LBO came about. A lawsuit was brought against the tobacco companies and the person bringing the suit was successful and paid $800,000 which didn't hurt the overall profits but it did cause the tobacco stocks to drop. This is the reason Johnson decided an LBO was the way to make the most profit for the shareholders rather than to fix the problem by producing for example a smoke-less cigarette which everyone thought was disgusting. Warren Buffett is mentioned in this story and he advised these LBO masters that tobacco although has a negative place in people's minds regarding health it was worth the risk because each cigarette cost one penny to make. I think this book drifts off after the first 3rd and becomes a bore as it spent too much time discussing the negotiations and the back and forth and the several different banks, firms, and lawyers trying to be the ones to make the deal. If you have a high-ranking title at a big corporation or if you were part of the story then the second half of this book might be more interesting than it was to me. I am sure these ego maniacs involved in the story loved this book. The takeaway from this book is that when people have access to a large corporation that produces a wide range of successful American brands from Camel cigarettes to Oreo cookies then lots of money can be recklessly thrown at it so that someone else can play with this money-making machine. This book leaves you yurning for more action and omg moments but they don't really happen, just a lot of expressions of anger and nasty phone conversations. The final chapter couldn't come soon enough as the tension and suspense seemed mostly manufactured, no one dies and everyone gets rich. I think this book could use an update of where are they now, however, I've used the Barbarians Wikipedia page to go down the rabbit hole a little bit. The company, which is just Nabisco after the tobacco part of the company was sold off to a Japanese company in 1999, was scraped for parts after the LBO. This [wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabisco#Subsequent_acquisitions_and_divestitures) explains how parts of RJR Nabisco were sold off since the 1989 takeover. I wanted to explore something about large American corporations and I found the story of their humble beginnings the more interesting part of the story. *- 5/24/23*

Rodriguez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_J._Rodriguez) **Narrated by:** Luis J. Rodriguez **Length:** 10 hrs and 35 mins **Rating:** 4.6 – This book takes place in the era of **1960-1990** primarily in southern California in South San Gabriel. This is the first memoir that I've listened to that is narrated by the author. In Luis' own voice he tells us of his parent's background living in Mexico and how his family eventually moved to Los Angeles. He describes the hardships of his parents not being able to obtain good jobs even though his father was a high school principal in Mexico and his mother was educated. He describes the segregation of wealthier families of the surrounding neighborhoods such as South Gate and Monterey Park from families such as his who lived in "the hills" and how this inequality was applied in the school classrooms. Luis weaves in and out from his part-time jobs growing up and his eventual thirst for joining the tough neighborhood gangs as if to bring the reader into his reasons for wanting to join a gang. Luis does not feel appreciated and is not particularly skillful in athletics and academics like his older brother. The gangs provided something that he felt he was good at. He paints a very vivid picture of the many conflicts he ran up against while keeping such company as his fellow gang members. He writes in a poetic tone and he is an author who wants to articulate the grit of his existence and the violence he was associated with. Luis mentions the book title in relation to Always Running from the cops and how the law made the Latino people always feel less than in southern California. These resentments towards being treated unfairly led to a huge clash between the classes right in the middle of this story. This book describes Luis' detailed sexual experiences and some of the depravity he observed within the gangs. He describes how his troubles made him change schools until he eventually found a teacher who believed in his writing talent. Luis tells us about his activism toward such things as equal education and demanding classes about Chicano studies be taught by Chicano teachers. This book is about his struggle to do more with his life, avoid the dead-end that gangs provided, empathize with his family, and mourn those lost to senseless violence. Luis offers us a look at different American experiences in the latter half of the 20th century and it can be a cautionary tale for those on a similar path. It seemed like the LA riots of 1992 inspired Luis to write about his past life in Los Angeles, just like the east LA riots and the Chicano moratorium had a profound impact on Luis when he was young. *- 6/25/22*

The story opens in a small rural neighborhood called the bario. Esmeralda's family struggled with steady work and income thus they moved around. Esmeralda in her own voice tells us about the food she ate, the descriptive style of her lodgings, and her siblings. She tells us about her role as the oldest sibling and how she observes the relationship between her parents. This is a story of a young girl's life starting in Peurto Rico and the shock of a new beginning as a teenager learning the social order of Brooklyn, NY. I like this story because I get to see a person's life before moving to America and all the differences in culture for better or worse. It allowed me to think about how this story could be applied to all those who emigrated to America, such as my great grandparents, with English not being their first language. Esmeralda explains this perfectly, expecting the streets to be paved in gold and her amazement at the size of the markets in New York City. Esmeralda describes people and their mannerisms so well and describes their clothing and jewelry to really bring you into this story. Her main subject is her mother and she elaborates on the intimate conversations that she shared with her father. Esmerelda paints what she went through and the many characters that she dealt with in **1960s** Brooklyn. She gives us a social breakdown of the ethnic classes of her middle school and the styles of the time. The last few chapters are a close look at growing up in Williamsburg Brooklyn and the desire to escape it. The oldest of a large family Esmerelda shined in this inspirational tale of starting a new life in America. *- 7/18/22*

The story goes into a lengthy explanation of the family history of both the author's mother and father. The author's objective is to uncover the secrets of his family and the causes that led to his brother becoming a murderer. Like a domino effect, things that the parents passed on to their kids through physical and verbal abuse could have been the eventual reason that Gary became violent. Mikal spotlights the time Gary spent incarcerated and the abuse he incurred and delivered while behind bars. Mikal spends time talking about each of his brothers, their experiences, and how they dealt with their family dramas and managed their way through life. I wanted my research on American history to include a story of true crime. I find the topics of crime and psychoanalyzing family dynamics to be very interesting. True crime stories make for an engaging audiobook experience. Mikal goes into his mother's Mormon upbringing with so much detail that it reminded me of how much Mark Twain spent talking about the Mormons in his book [Roughing It](#twain) back in 1872. There are so many interesting characters that come to life in this memoir which takes place in **1920s and 1930s** depression era Utah and in the **1950s and 1960s** Pacific North West. This story spanning seven decades is a heartfelt look at an American family living on the west coast in the middle of the 20th century. *- 7/30/22*

Evans with his tough east coast bravado briefly writes about his childhood growing up in Harlem and talks about his father who was considered a generous dentist in a low-income neighborhood. He walks us through his acting career which lends to the title of this book. While acting in movies he observed the Hollywood machine and all the players that make a movie come together. He explains leaving acting behind and using his inspiration to find other ways to be involved in movie making. He explains how he stumbled into success, yet he also explains how when opportunity meets preparation he turned it into a major role of producing movies for Paramount Pictures. He paints the canvas of the bosses he had to deliver the goods to at Paramount and through a strong list of hits in the late 1960s into the early 1970s Evans describes how he created a new Hollywood. While researching all the real life characters that Evans describes it had me fantasizing about living life in Los Angeles and partying with the celebrities of that time. It's baffling to see these pictures of all these people in their prime and now most of them have passed on or are approaching their 90s. Evans really lived a life especially in the 1950s he rubbed elbows with the hollywood generation that came before him. As far as my thirst for American life I could have used more day to day and descriptive images of the past and less personal details but that's the limitations of memoirs. I usually prefer memoirs that do deep dives on their parents and extended family because you get more into the past that way but this book is a knockout story of a tough jewish new yorker rising to the top of the mountain of hollywood and if nothing else it's inspirational. You will definitely get a taste of the language, attitude and the vibe of a ball breaking film producer by listening to this book. This is about a uniquely American business beloved around the world. A slight parallel to Richard Pryor’s memoir is that cocaine was also an issue for Evans but he doesn’t talk about it nearly as much as it was a recurring center piece for Pryor.  *- 9/22/22*

40.	![Pryor Convictions, and Other Life Sentences cover image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51A1C0MyVPL._SL150_.jpg) (Published 1995) [Pryor Convictions, and Other Life Sentences](https://www.audible.com/pd/Pryor-Convictions-Audiobook/B079DW264M) by [Richard Pryor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Pryor) **Narrated by:** JD Jackson **Length:** 7 hrs and 41 mins **Rating:** 4.6 **Genre:** Memoir – This story starts off in Peoria, Illinois in the era of **1940s-1950s** and follows Pryor through his eventful childhood to his journey to fame and fortune in California **1960s-1970s**. Richard explains a broken yet supportive family that was used against him when he tried to attend school. He writes about being a sensitive, thoughtful, and a rather skinny and vulnerable child. Pryor explains how one teacher noticed his talents early on and allowed him to perform for his classmates. Richard unpacks his journey away from a small town to New York City where he started getting noticed. Richard tells his story in a very candid manner he doesn't hold back about his many sexual experiences, private moments around his famous friends, and his flagrant use of cocaine. In New York I was surprised to learn he was a part of the Greenwich Village scene in the early 1960s and he rubbed elbows with Bob Dylan and a cocky Woody Allen who once told Richard to pay attention to his set and he might learn something. Richard takes us through many more amazing stories of the **1960s** painting vivid pictures of that time in American history such as hanging out with Bill Cosby, partying with members of the black Panthers and opening shows for Miles Davis. Pryor has mostly a serious tone in this book and by the weight of his story's content you understand why. His story is honest and it's not always the most flattering image of himself however, Richard explains the pressure he felt to take care of family back home in Peoria. In all of the books that I've read to this point it seems to be the most drug use I've read about one person consuming and it's amazing to think someone could survive that much partying. Richard explains putting his body through the ringer which probably led to his mental health being unstable at times. This book is similar to [Dick Gregory's biography](#dg) but Richard's story lacked direction and rather explored depression and burn out. This is a close look at being a celebrity in America and the ups and downs and the strain it can have on a person when they expose so much of themselves on stage. By reading this I had an opportunity to take a wild ride that I'd never experience in my own life and it was an honor to be on the Pryor roller coaster. *- 9/9/22*

Douglas,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Douglas) Mark Olshaker **Narrated by:** Richard M. Davidson **Length:** 15 hrs and 24 mins **Rating:** 4.6 **Genre:** Non-fiction – This story is about John E. Douglas' experience getting hired by the FBI, which was in the final years under the direction of J. Edgar Hoover, and working in a variety of fields within the berue in the **1970s**. John tells us about his upbringing in Long Island, New York, his college experience in Montana and his eventual signing up for the United States air force in the era of **1950s-1960s**. He describes how through a series of connections while in the military and his intelligence he exhibited while in college he ended up trying out for the FBI through a recruitment from a friend who was an FBI agent. As John walks us through his past he uses murder cases that happeded in his life time to help us understand the mind of a criminal and how he devised a way to create a profile of a criminal that isn't able to be found. John tells us about his time as a sniper for the SWAT team and how he dealt with negotiations during the rise of bank robberies in the 70s and the best ways they came up with to thwart them. John explains how he found that by working as a bouncer at a bar in his college days he learned how to read people's behavior to avoid conflict and deasculate possible violence and how this interested him which led him to seek the BS (behavioral science) department of the FBI. John mentions the famous criminal profilers that he studied and looked up to such as Robert K. Ressler. I am very fascinated how profilers can create a profile of a criminal based on the evidence of a crime. John describes his super power in a very engaging way and he unpacks this science by telling us about how he learned by interviewing the most famous American criminals of the second half 20th century. This was during a period of time of an unsual rise of indirect linked murders. It was amazing how John describes how he could start telling you features such as a suspect will have scruffy hair by the forensic evidence left behind at the scene of a murder. John can tell us depending on where a body is found and tell you whether a suspect has social skills or not. I found it fascinating that such a useful practice could be perfected to almost wipe out serial killers completely. If not for John Douglas going into the mind of these violent criminals and teaching law enforcement in between these meetings we might be living in a much scarier world. I love the idea of analyzing people's reasons and what led them to perform such grotesque and anti-social acts. The burning question for John was that are killers born or are they made and for the most part almost all the suspects had trauma in their pasts. He found with more love in their lives perhaps they never would have turned to violence as their way of letting out their pent up rage. If nothing else you may learn just how to protect yourself with some situational awareness and how to understand how to make a profile by following the clues left behind. It doesn't always have to be a crime of murder that one might want to find out why someone would steal, or threaten, or vandelize and figuring out the trigger of such behavior is a useful activity. John did pose the question to why indirect killing had become so common in the 20th century while he says it could have also happened in the past but not as frequently as it does today but this book has made me think about that very question as well. Is it the breaking down of family, isolation, disillusionment, future shock, all of it? Now that the methodical planning to kill a person within a long span of time which is a serial killer's strategy has gone away it has been replaced by mass shootings, which I'm sure John would tell you is closely related to the mind of a serial killer. Just as well as achievements and downfalls are apart of the American story, so is the taboo of random violence and the practice of criminal psychology.  *- 9/30/22*

This book jumps around in time sequences going from the investigation, to the victim's backstories and families, to FBI Special Agent Dwayne Fuselier’s psycho analysis of the killers, to the details on the day of the attack, to the thoughts of the parents of the victims and survivors. This book took a snapshot of it all. It's not the violent content that you wish to relive by reading this book but it is the curiosity of why such a bold action was unleashed on innocent people and why it is so memorable to people suh as myself. I was just 19 years old at the time of this tragedy. It left an imprint on me and I can still remember watching the Columbine students fleeing the school as the news media went wild with constant updates about what they thought was happening. Dave Cullen captures the chaos of the moment and if you can stomach it he will take you into the school that was suddenly turned into a war zone. As I said before, people should not read this book to relive the violence but to understand how normal teenagers, who seemed to have everything they could want, with stable intact families, mother and father not divorced and yet they could still convince themselves that the world should pay for their unhappines and unfullfilment. How does the nacisicitc mind convince kids like this to punish those who not only have done nothing to them but also struggle with the same sense of unfullfillments and disapopintments of their own. Why do killers think their problems are unique and they must hurt people near them. I was a teenager in a quiet suburb just like they were.This is a book that describes 1990s teenage American suburban life very well. The 1990s was the era of my teenage upbringing and I can see the similarities between their surroundings, video games, and culture of that time period. If you were alive at this time then you probably remember that the news covered this story closely for many weeks after it occurred but Dave takes you into the actual investigation without all the embellishments and sensationalism created by the news media complex. Dave states how the motives of the shooters were given a narrative without actually knowing the facts. Dave takes us through all of the mischiefs, journals and vlogs (video cassette confesions) left behind by Eric and Dylan leading up to April 1999. Dave describes the grieving of the town and the religious fervor that tried to throw a blanket over the struggling families that were trying to piece together what had just happened to them. Dave says in his book, “Eric killed for two reasons, to demonstrate his superiority and to enjoy it. To a psychopath that motive makes sense.”. Chapter 40 of this book titled “Psychopath” is a good essay on the topic of Pyscopathy. This is a book about two kids who had it too easy and chose to be sadistic because they were bored. In the United States since Columbine there have been 70 more school shootings before the publication of this book and there have been 335 more school shootings after this book was published. There have been more than 400 school shootings in America since Columbine. This of course excludes other mass shootings that occur outside of a school and other mass shootings that take place in other countries. In fact, just in the past 3 days there have been at least 3 mass shootings in California with unknown motives just like Columbine. I'd say this has become a common occurrence in American culture and worth taking a look at to further understand how some people choose to express their unsatisfied feeling towards living within all the things that can reach us in society. When I was in high school in 1995 a friend of mine was caught trading a pellet gun for a police baton, he was suspended for bringing a weapon to school. It was an innocent transaction, the school just happened to be the best place to make this trade for him. That is the only thing I can think of besides perhaps a much older student that was rumored to blow the doors off the high school with a pipe bomb while the school was empty and not during functional hours. I believe this kid was arrested for that. I can't even imagine something as wicked as Columbine or all the shootings that have followed since. Over the years I have stayed in small groups and don't spend much time in places where lots of people gather, I tend to feel better this way but it has also allowed me to hide away from these chaotic situations when they do randomly occur. It's hard to truly understand the weight and the terror unless you've experienced being shot at or seeing people being shot at in person. It is a hard situation to imagine being involved in. This book is going to bring you along the shoulder of everyone involved and the perspective right down to their reaction to watching the vlogs left behind by the killers. I think it's important to digest this type of suffering. The epidemic of people feeling like they are the only person dealing with something so crushing that they must destroy everything around them is something I see as an American problem. This youtube video is a great copilot to this book https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5QG-I9Ced0. It summarizes everything in the book and it puts some faces to names.   *- 1/06/23*

2.	![The Great Depression: A Diary cover image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51jOhmk+XtL._SL150_.jpg) (Published 2009) [The Great Depression: A Diary](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Great-Depression-Audiobook/B0030E4PYU?source_code=GO1OR12109072190Y3&gclid=Cj0KCQiAw8OeBhCeARIsAGxWtUxQRDmoKF8kWXFis-fwaXmuoYhYqXBCj1uqEZQAT6cuF6elA025GqIaAnhsEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) by James Ledbetter, Daniel B. Roth **Narrated by:** Mike Chamberlain  **Length:** 12 hrs and 24 mins  **Rating:** 4.4  **Genre:** Memoir / American History – This book is a first-hand account of a monumental time of economic despair in America in the era of **1929-1941**. The descriptions of despair are written by Daniel Roth's father Benjamin who was living in this moment of uncertainty. He wondered when things were going to go back to normal again and this is why he decided to document the daily events of this important time in American history. Benjamin can recall a time when teachers were not able to be paid and farmers who could not make money from their harvest would rather dump it than allow the government to foreclose on their land and fix their prices. Benjamin writes short and concise journal entries that are easy to understand. The entries are edited with context from James Ledbetter to convey the points Benjamin was trying to convey. This book does not flow in a normal storytelling manner. It is true to its journaling nature but for that reason, Benjamin repeats many earth-shifting moments over and over so these milestones become ingrained in the reader's mind therefore their importance is understood. Just like I pointed out while reading Eleanor Roosevelt's bio, this book has many parallels such as the description of the Bonus Army, a group of WWI soldiers who gathered outside the capital to demand economic security for their prior service and how the fallout of this was perceived by the public. This is a must-read to get the perspective of the working people during a frightening time that was accentuated by unpaid war debts and many countries leaving the gold standard and pulling their investments out of America. In Chapter 2 Benjamin references a speech about the current state of things in August 1931 he writes, "In 1931 European countries became demoralized, and suffered breakdown and revolution. England went off gold standard and was rapidly followed by Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Australia, India, and Egypt. All Europe withdrew her gold from U.S., European investors were scared and dumped their American stocks and bonds on the market and withdrew more gold. Then the people of U.S. followed suit and withdrew their savings for the purpose of hoarding. And this caused our banks to fail. This was followed by Japanese war and breakdown in Germany. This went on for 18 months.". Benjamin doesn't fail to do what I love most about reading first-hand history in that he references a book he is reading at the moment of his journaling, he states that he is reading [The Tragic Era](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/2493047) by Claude G. Bowers about the economic collapse of 1873 and he explains with childish excitement how many similarities he found between the two time periods. Ben offers many wise things to follow to avoid being swallowed up by another economic disaster such as recommending to sell all stocks at the height of the boom and investing in government bonds. He reads updates of the actual costs of stocks periodically sprinkled throughout his descriptions of local news and global stirrings such as the war between Japan and China. Towards the end of this book in the final chapters Roth describes how the depression would dance between boom and bust. People would get their hopes up and start buying stocks and either get wiped out or hold on long to sell at the right time and make a fortune. The final chapter of this book was very interesting because it describes the beginning of WWII as Roth journals the chronological invasions by Germany of other countries. Roth continued to write in his journal until his death in 1978 but the book ends in 1941 just as USA was getting to enter the war which would be the main catalyst that would save the economy for the foreseeable future. Chapter 7 at the 11:30 minute mark on January 5th, 1940 Roth writes, "As I look over the decade just closed, it all seems like a bad dream. I hope neither I nor my children will go through such an experience again. None of my children remember the pre-depression era. They have only known the blackest depression, uncertainty, European wars, talk of communism, socialism, and fascism. Even their school books are filled with these subjects. The philosophy of Franklin and Lincoln are all ancient history. Our government debt is over 40 billion dollars and mounting. Our country is swayed by European propaganda and subversive activities. All and all the world of 1940 is not a pleasant one." This book will take you back in time, you can really feel how tough it was to be alive and raise a family during the great depression. It may help us take a look around today and realize things are not so bad. An American story of caution, pragmatism, hope, and self-preservation. *- 1/25/23*

The story is written like an investigative journalist with an inquisitive and questionable opinion of the suspicious activity that went on in LC spanning the era of the **1960s - 1970s**. McGowan’s theory is that there was something more sinister going on behind the smiling innocence of the peace and love hippie music scene. I didn't fully buy into the opinion that this whole flower power scene was a scam and that every drug overdose was a way to cover up the truth hidden in the crevices of LC but it did change how I think of the music and the people who created it. This book mentions major musical figures such as Jim Morrison, David Crosby, and Frank Zappa who took residence in LC at the time of this investigation. McGowan also goes deep into the lives of the hippie gurus [Vito Paulekas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vito_Paulekas) and Carl Franzoni that inspired the hippie movement that swept the nation. This is not a flattering tale that shows any of these people in a glossy contextual way. This book goes into the dark places and the negligent behavior of these people. The irresponsible way they raised children and the creepy cults they associated with. It's not surprising that most of these musicians didn't live very long but McGowan wonders if there was more behind these random cults and the violence that occurred in LC. He points out that the image of these rock groups said one thing but the reality completely contradicts peace and love. McGowan creates skepticism in this book by describing the presence of the US government which had a movie studio called Lookout Mountain Laboratory that made movies for the United States military. His main premise is that the hippie movement and the music behind it were created by powerful people to discredit the anti-war movement. McGowan attempts to back up this premise by detailing deaths that occurred under suspicious circumstances. McGowan suggests this was a way to intimidate those who may have known too much. Although I didn't believe every argument Mcgowan puts forth it is, however, a fun read to see how all these bands I grew up listening to (by way of my father's music collection) were birthed into the scene. It's like taking a peak behind the beaded curtain. McGowan is a California native and lived through the 60s in southern California. This book is going to send you into a Google search rabbit hole and what I found was beautiful inquisitive American gold. This is the first biography I read based on an American musician's perspective and many of the subjects of this content had their autobiographies referenced most of which are not found on audible so this book is a great synopsis of American musicians from the later half of the 20th century. The Charles Mason murders and “the family” are a main thread throughout this book and the most interesting and curious circumstances in this book. I already knew CM had connections with The Beach Boys but how CM and his disciples become so violent is a story that deserves more attention and it does in The book Chaos which I plan to read. Dave McGowan passed away from Cancer in 2015 a fews years after he published this book, here is an interview I found of Dave talking about this book [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSzmvkja-qQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSzmvkja-qQ). *- 3/23/23*

# Native American History (audible books)

I wanted to learn about the history of the Native Americans that inhabited the North American region. Although during my initial study of American History there are many references to American Indian tribes and their relationship with the European settlers I want to hear about their history through their experiences. The stories from the 19th century are sad as many of the native tribes were moved off of their land, killed by disease, and many died fighting. I hope to learn more about Native American history that goes back to before the Europeans sailed to America. I am curious about how the Native Americans lived and got along amongst the various different American Indian tribes.

1. ![Ishi in Two Worlds cover image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51iym4WD9sL._SL150_.jpg) (Published 1961) [* Ishi in Two Worlds: A Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America](https://www.audible.com/pd/Ishi-in-Two-Worlds-Audiobook/B002V5BCEA) by [Theodora Kroeber, Karl Kroeber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodora_Kroeber) **Narrated by:** Lorna Raver **Length:** 10 hrs and 47 mins **Rating:** 4.4 **Genre:** History – This story takes place in Northern California and covers the era of **1840-1914**. This book recounts the history of the Yahi Native American people. The Yahi were a part of the Yana Native American tribe. Theodora explains how the Yahi people lived and communicated in the scenic foothills of Mount Lassen north of Sacramento. The title describes exactly what this book is about. The first part is about a Native American man named Ishi living his indigenous daily life as his ancestors did for thousands of years until the Native land of the Yahi had been granted to pioneers new to California. In the second half of the book, Ishi is discovered dehydrated and starving and he is sent to live at the San Francisco museum. From then on Ishi started to live in the modern world. Theodora's husband Alfred Kroeber worked with Ishi and helped him adjust to contemporary life in the city. Alfred, who was an anthropologist, felt that the story of Ishi was too emotional for him to write about, therefore his wife Theodora took on the task and wrote a very in-depth history of this exciting time in California history. Alfred and some other specialists helped to document Ishi's language and Ishi showed off the techniques of how the Yahi built tools and made arrows using the ancient techniques passed down to him. The Yahi history goes back at least 3,000 years in Northern California and realizing Ishi was the last living member made him an exceptional person to this community. Sadly and perhaps the people of the time didn't realize that Ishi was seen as a spectacle to curious audiences but I think they meant well and really wanted to learn about the life of the ancient and extinct Yahi people. Ishi shares his own stories and folklore passed down to him from the Yahi traditions. This book includes a breakdown of the pioneers that flocked to Northern California during the gold rush and the conflicts with the Yahi that eventually lead to the Yahi people's extinction. Theodora shares excerpts from [J. Goldsborough Bruff's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goldsborough_Bruff) journal and his interactions with the Yahi while he was making his way through the Yana territory in the 1840s. Theodora explains the pioneer’s negative feelings toward the Yahi without holding back. She is trying to figure out what happened and who was responsible all the way up to when Ishi was the last living member of the Yahi.  *- 8/19/22*

It is a very brutally honest history about the American Indian tribes of the western part of America and how they were treated by the United States government. There are also some stories about the relationships of some tribes and their relationship with Mexicans as well. Each chapter covers an individual Native American tribe (for example Navajo, Sioux, and Apache to name a few) and their experiences. There are many battles detailed in this book some of which were won by the American Indians but most of the battles were won by the united states military (blue coats) by their advantage in numbers and modern weaponry. This book does not have many happy moments however there are times of peace and there are words of peace expressed by some of the tribal leaders towards the white man, but there seemed to be a need for the government to make Native Americans live like them which the Indians did not desire to. There are many famous names mentioned in this book such as Kit Carson, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, General Custar, Cochise, Geronimo and many more names which I had the pleasure to google and then I could see photographs of all the people mentioned in this book which helped me visualize the stories better. There is a wonderful chapter about Ely S. Parker who was a Native American Indian and served with President Grant in the civil war. Ely was later appointed Commissioner of Indian Affairs. In this 21 year span, the United States government obviously wanted to expand the new American-European population and have them settle in western America and they viewed the Indians as something in their way and wanted to relocate them off of their beloved land. And obviously, the Indians did not want to leave the land where they had success hunting and living off the land to be moved to an undesired part of the country which could cause all kinds of problems so there was bound to be battles and push back to these broken promises. It is suggested that some of the generals in charge of the US soldiers made up reasons to persuade the president to keep them in the west so that the soldiers could avoid the much more dangerous conflict by serving in the civil war. The United States government wanted to build railroads, headquarters, military posts and start building new towns for people to settle into and try to make them safe by showing a military presence and Dee Brown tells this head-shaking story without missing a thing.

# European History (audible books)

The history of Europe is an interesting topic because I can find a lot more books published in the 17th century. Getting a firsthand account of the foundations of what would eventually branch out and become America and the influences Europe has had had around the world will be an eye opening study for me.

1. ![A Tale of Two Cities cover image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51EXuEOQIiL._SL150_.jpg) (Published 1859) [* A Tale of Two Cities](https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Tale-of-Two-Cities-Audiobook/B0773Z4GB6?qid=1651867971&sr=1-1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&pf_rd_r=GJWNN8AEC4NT4TJ27ATJ) by [Charles Dickens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens) **Narrated by:** Simon Callow **Length:** 15 hrs **Rating:** 4.6 **Genre:** Historical Novel – This book is a historical novel about the events leading up to and the occurrences during the French Revolution. The story covers the era of **1775-1792**. The first part of the story starts off very slow, but Dickens is trying to carefully establish his main characters and show the egregious treatment of the working-class people by the aristocrats. Dickens narrates in 3rd person following Darnay his wife Lucie and her Farther Dr. Manet. Dickens was helped by Thomas Carlyle's novel and a few other books about the French revolution to help with language and historical events. Starting in 1775 the story wants to show the indifference the aristocrats had toward the struggle of the poor to make a living and eat well. As the story progresses he shows the uprising of the people (the republic) which eventually takes over the prisons and turns the tables on the aristocrats and immigrants which they blame for all the mistreatment. The republic is blinded by the movement and perhaps Dickens shows the heavy-handed punishment handed down to all including women and children was taken too far. I wanted to read this book after reading [Rights of Man](#rom) by Thomas Paine so that I could get a better understanding of the French Revolution, what caused it, and what the results were. This book seems more character-driven but does offer the details and the feelings of the people of that time. Dickens was not alive during this period but just one generation removed so the stories of that time were still fresh. This book was difficult to follow and keep track of the characters, I recommend reading the Tale of Two Cities Wikipedia page and following the list of the character descriptions. I am more interested in the actual events of the revolution and not that interested in the drawn-out dialog and emotions of the characters as much but Dickens obviously was a superb writer and amazing at creating characters. *- 5/02/22*

1. ![Down and Out in Paris and London cover image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51yZBkCaoXL._SL150_.jpg) (Published 1933) [* Down and Out in Paris and London](https://www.audible.com/pd/Down-and-Out-in-Paris-and-London-Audiobook/B002V8LMG0)) by [Geroge Orwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell) **Narrated by:** Frederick Davidson  **Length:** 6 hrs and 33 mins  **Rating:** 4.5 **Genre:** Memoir  – This memoir covers the era of the late **1920s**. This book is in two parts, the first half is about Orwell working at a variety of restaurants in Paris and the second half is about his life as a tramp in London. Orwell offers his wisdom about the class struggle and what it’s like to live life in poverty in the early quarter of the 20th century. He philosophizes about why this type of low-income labor exists by saying in chapter 22 "To sum up: A plongeur (dishwasher) is a slave, and a wasted slave, doing stupid and largely unnecessary work. He is kept at work, ultimately, because of a vague feeling that he would be dangerous if he had leisure. And educated people, who should be on his side, acquiesce in the process because they know nothing about him and consequently are afraid of him.". Chapter 22 is an excellent chapter of Orwell ripping on unnecessary work that robs the laborer’s ability to think. Orwell commands that these meaningless jobs could be organized better to be less painful in the end for those who have no other options in way of means. Orwell offers more thoughts like this about doing ridiculous hard work for 18 hours a day 7 days a week and receiving little pay in hotel kitchens in Paris. Orwell uses skillful imagery to describe the condition of the kitchens as well as the strange habits of the customers. Orwell writes in an intelligent writing style to grab the attention of the educated and the wealthy class. He describes his friends that he worked with at this time and he paints life into these characters the way Mark Twain does by sharing their character’s boasting and contradictions with touches of humor. I found the first part more interesting than the second. I was a dishwasher as a teenager and can relate to the in-depth breakdown of kitchen hierarchy and the mundaneness of the work. I found out later that the first part was the original first draft that Orwell tried to publish but after two rejections he added the second half about tramp life in London. In the second half of this book, Orwell dedicates an entire chapter to writing out a glossary of English slang words and their literal meaning. He also describes in this chapter the type of English speaking that has gone out of fashion and predicts the same fate for the slang of his time. Orwell describes living life on the streets of London. He explains the ways to get by, how to hide money and how to find a safe place to sleep. The street people he comes in contact with share their stories of how they ended up so unfortunate and what they do to earn people's handouts.  Too weak himself to do heavy manual labor, we follow Orwell through his adventure as a tramp, it's interesting to see this side of life and his explanation of why he thinks people who are well-off look down on people who have ended up on the streets. A lot has changed in the last 100 years but there is a romanticism in this well-written documentation that can bring you into this rough way of living. I always enjoy it when authors share books in their stories and Orwell mentioned two which I then added to my audible list. The books he mentioned were The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle and White-Jacket by Herman Melville. Not only does this give me more ways to research the past but it reminds me that when I read something written nearly 100 years ago that the author is speaking directly to me even though he’s been dead for over 70 years and he’s sharing exactly what was on his mind 100 years ago.  *- 8/21/22*
